abstract: 'Abstract                            Motivation               Metabolite
  identification is an important task in metabolomics to enhance the knowledge of
  biological systems. There have been a number of machine learning-based methods proposed
  for this task, which predict a chemical structure of a given spectrum through an
  intermediate (chemical structure) representation called molecular fingerprints.
  They usually have two steps: (i) predicting fingerprints from spectra; (ii) searching
  chemical compounds (in database) corresponding to the predicted fingerprints. Fingerprints
  are feature vectors, which are usually very large to cover all possible substructures
  and chemical properties, and therefore heavily redundant, in the sense of having
  many molecular (sub)structures irrelevant to the task, causing limited predictive
  performance and slow prediction.                                         Results               We
  propose ADAPTIVE, which has two parts: learning two mappings (i) from structures
  to molecular vectors and (ii) from spectra to molecular vectors. The first part
  learns molecular vectors for metabolites from given data, to be consistent with
  both spectra and chemical structures of metabolites. In more detail, molecular vectors
  are generated by a model, being parameterized by a message passing neural network,
  and parameters are estimated by maximizing the correlation between molecular vectors
  and the corresponding spectra in terms of Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion.
  Molecular vectors generated by this model are compact and importantly adaptive (specific)
  to both given data and task of metabolite identification. The second part uses input
  output kernel regression (IOKR), the current cutting-edge method of metabolite identification.
  We empirically confirmed the effectiveness of ADAPTIVE by using a benchmark data,
  where ADAPTIVE outperformed the original IOKR in both predictive performance and
  computational efficiency.                                         Availability and
  implementation               The code will be accessed through http://www.bic.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pathway/tools/ADAPTIVE
  after the acceptance of this article.'
