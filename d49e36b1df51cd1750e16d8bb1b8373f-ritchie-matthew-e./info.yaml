abstract: limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated
  solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features
  for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
  the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular
  choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray
  and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities
  for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of
  limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package
  can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses
  of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted
  to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow
  users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second,
  the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses
  in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets
  of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced
  possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
  article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both
  new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features
  that have not been previously described.
