  \                 <jats:p>The interaction between tumor and immune system plays
  a crucial role in both cancer development and treatment response. To facilitate
  comprehensive investigation of tumor–immune interactions, we have designed a user-friendly
  web portal TISIDB, which integrated multiple types of data resources in oncoimmunology.
  First, we manually curated 4176 records from 2530 publications, which reported 988
  genes related to anti-tumor immunity. Second, genes associated with the resistance
  or sensitivity of tumor cells to T cell-mediated killing and immunotherapy were
  identified by analyzing high-throughput screening and genomic profiling data. Third,
  associations between any gene and immune features, such as lymphocytes, immunomodulators
  and chemokines, were pre-calculated for 30 TCGA cancer types. In TISIDB, biologists
  can cross-check a gene of interest about its role in tumor–immune interactions through
  literature mining and high-throughput data analysis, and generate testable hypotheses
  and high quality figures for publication.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n
