abstract: Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) and conjugated linolenic acids (CLNAs)
  have gained significant attention due to their anticarcinogenic and lipid/energy
  metabolism-modulatory effects. However, their concentration in foodstuffs is insufficient
  for any therapeutic application to be implemented. From a biotechnological standpoint,
  microbial production of these conjugated fatty acids (CFAs) has been explored as
  an alternative, and strains of the genera Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, and
  Bifidobacterium have shown promising producing capacities. Current screening research
  works are generally based on direct analytical determination of production capacity
  (e.g., trial and error), representing an important bottleneck in these studies.
  This review aims to summarize the available information regarding identified genes
  and proteins involved in CLA/CLNA production by these groups of bacteria and, consequently,
  the possible enzymatic reactions behind such metabolic processes. Linoleate isomerase
  (LAI) was the first enzyme to be described to be involved in the microbiological
  transformation of linoleic acids (LAs) and linolenic acids (LNAs) into CFA isomers.
  Thus, the availability of lai gene sequences has allowed the development of genetic
  screening tools. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that LAIs have significant
  homology with myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) proteins, which are involved
  in the synthesis of hydroxy fatty acids, as shown by hydratase activity. Furthermore,
  it has been suggested that CLA and/or CLNA production results from a stress response
  performed by the activation of more than one gene in a multiple-step reaction. Studies
  on CFA biochemical pathways are essential to understand and characterize the metabolic
  mechanism behind this process, unraveling all the gene products that may be involved.
  As some of these bacteria have shown modulation of lipid metabolism in vivo, further
  research to be focused on this topic may help us to understand the role of the gut
  microbiota in human health.
