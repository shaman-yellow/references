abstract: 'BACKGROUND Pathogenesis and diagnostic biomarkers for diseases can be discovered
  by metabolomic profiling of human fluids. If the various types of coronary artery
  disease (CAD) can be accurately characterized by metabolomics, effective treatment
  may be targeted without using unnecessary therapies and resources. OBJECTIVES The
  authors studied disturbed metabolic pathways to assess the diagnostic value of metabolomics-based
  biomarkers in different types of CAD. METHODS A cohort of 2,324 patients from 4
  independent centers was studied. Patients underwent coronary angiography for suspected
  CAD. Groups were divided as follows: normal coronary artery (NCA), nonobstructive
  coronary atherosclerosis (NOCA), stable angina (SA), unstable angina (UA), and acute
  myocardial infarction (AMI). Plasma metabolomic profiles were determined by liquid
  chromatography\textendash quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and were analyzed
  by multivariate statistics. RESULTS We made 12 cross-comparisons to and within CAD
  to characterize metabolic disturbances. We focused on comparisons of NOCA versus
  NCA, SA versus NOCA, UA versus SA, and AMI versus UA. Other comparisons were made,
  including SA versus NCA, UA versus NCA, AMI versus NCA, UA versus NOCA, AMI versus
  NOCA, AMI versus SA, significant CAD (SA/UA/AMI) versus nonsignificant CAD (NCA/NOCA),
  and acute coronary syndrome (UA/AMI) versus SA. A total of 89 differential metabolites
  were identified. The altered metabolic pathways included reduced phospholipid catabolism,
  increased amino acid metabolism, increased short-chain acylcarnitines, decrease
  in tricarboxylic acid cycle, and less biosynthesis of primary bile acid. For differential
  diagnosis, 12 panels of specific metabolomics-based biomarkers provided areas under
  the curve of 0.938 to 0.996 in the discovery phase (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1,086), predictive
  values of 89.2\% to 96.0\% in the test phase (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 933), and 85.3\%
  to 96.4\% in the 3-center external sets (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 305). CONCLUSIONS Plasma
  metabolomics are powerful for characterizing metabolic disturbances. Differences
  in small-molecule metabolites may reflect underlying CAD and serve as biomarkers
  for CAD progression. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2016;68:1281\textendash 93) \textcopyright{}
