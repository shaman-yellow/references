abstract: To date, 205 compounds have been identified from different medicinal parts
  of Eucommia ulmoides, including lignans, iridoid terpenoids, phenols, flavonoids,
  terpenoids and steroids, polysaccharides and others. Their pharmacological effects
  include blood pressure-lowering, blood sugar-lowering, blood lipids-regulating,
  prevention of osteoporosis, anti-inflammation, liver protection, anti-cancer and
  so on. Their efficacy and mechanism from different parts are slightly different.
  In this paper, the chemical composition, pharmacological action and mechanism of
  different parts of E. ulmoides were systematically summarized, as well as its quality
  control and processing research, to provide theoretical basis for further rational
  development and utilization of E. ulmoides.
