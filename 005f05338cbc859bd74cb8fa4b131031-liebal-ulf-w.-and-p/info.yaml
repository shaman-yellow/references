abstract: The metabolome of an organism depends on environmental factors and intracellular
  regulation and provides information about the physiological conditions. Metabolomics
  helps to understand disease progression in clinical settings or estimate metabolite
  overproduction for metabolic engineering. The most popular analytical metabolomics
  platform is mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS metabolome data analysis is complicated,
  since metabolites interact nonlinearly, and the data structures themselves are complex.
  Machine learning methods have become immensely popular for statistical analysis
  due to the inherent nonlinear data representation and the ability to process large
  and heterogeneous data rapidly. In this review, we address recent developments in
  using machine learning for processing MS spectra and show how machine learning generates
  new biological insights. In particular, supervised machine learning has great potential
  in metabolomics research because of the ability to supply quantitative predictions.
  We review here commonly used tools, such as random forest, support vector machines,
  artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. During processing steps, the
  supervised machine learning methods help peak picking, normalization, and missing
  data imputation. For knowledge-driven analysis, machine learning contributes to
  biomarker detection, classification and regression, biochemical pathway identification,
  and carbon flux determination. Of important relevance is the combination of different
  omics data to identify the contributions of the various regulatory levels. Our overview
  of the recent publications also highlights that data quality determines analysis
  quality, but also adds to the challenge of choosing the right model for the data.
  Machine learning methods applied to MS-based metabolomics ease data analysis and
  can support clinical decisions, guide metabolic engineering, and stimulate fundamental
  biological discoveries.
