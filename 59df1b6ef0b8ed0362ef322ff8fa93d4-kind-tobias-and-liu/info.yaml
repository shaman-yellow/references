abstract: Current tandem mass spectral libraries for lipid annotations in metabolomics
  are limited in size and diversity. We provide a freely available computer-generated
  tandem mass spectral library of 212,516 spectra covering 119,200 compounds from
  26 lipid compound classes, including phospholipids, glycerolipids, bacterial lipoglycans
  and plant glycolipids. We show platform independence by using tandem mass spectra
  from 40 different mass spectrometer types including low-resolution and high-resolution
  instruments.
