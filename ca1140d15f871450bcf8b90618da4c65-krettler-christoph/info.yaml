abstract: Metabolomics, the comprehensive study of the metabolome, and lipidomics\textemdash
  the large-scale study of pathways and networks of cellular lipids\textemdash are
  major driving forces in enabling personalized medicine. Complicated and error-prone
  data analysis still remains a bottleneck, however, especially for identifying novel
  metabolites. Comparing experimental mass spectra to curated databases containing
  reference spectra has been the gold standard for identification of compounds, but
  constructing such databases is a costly and time-demanding task. Many software applications
  try to circumvent this process by utilizing cutting-edge advances in computational
  methods\textemdash including quantum chemistry and machine learning\textemdash and
  simulate mass spectra by performing theoretical, so called in silico fragmentations
  of compounds. Other solutions concentrate directly on experimental spectra and try
  to identify structural properties by investigating reoccurring patterns and the
  relationships between them. The considerable progress made in the field allows recent
  approaches to provide valuable clues to expedite annotation of experimental mass
  spectra. This review sheds light on individual strengths and weaknesses of these
  tools, and attempts to evaluate them\textemdash especially in view of lipidomics,
  when considering complex mixtures found in biological samples as well as mass spectrometer
  inter-instrument variability.
