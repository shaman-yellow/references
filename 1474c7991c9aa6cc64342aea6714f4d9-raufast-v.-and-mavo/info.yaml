abstract: There are a large number of studies on the pharmacological activity of lineolic
  acid (LA) on the skin; however, very little work has been carried out to determine
  how LA targets the follicular structure. The aim of this study was to identify the
  preferred route of penetration of LA and to localize the molecule, using a microautoradiographic
  technique associated with a compartmental approach. In an in vitro test using topical
  application of 0.05 g of a formulation containing 1\% of LA, 10\% of the total recovery
  was found in the stratum corneum and dermis after 6 h. Microautoradiographic analysis
  of a 'virtual' slide showed most of the silver grains, i.e. LA, at the hair sheath,
  and none in the dermal compartment, confirming the diffusion of LA through a preferred
  transfollicular route. These results show, for the first time on human scalp skin,
  that the combination of compartmental analysis and microautoradiography points to
  a preferred transfollicular route of diffusion of topically applied LA. Thanks to
  its high-resolution, microautoradiography offers the advantage of providing detailed
  in situ information on the delivery of LA in the skin, including the cellular location
  of the molecule.
