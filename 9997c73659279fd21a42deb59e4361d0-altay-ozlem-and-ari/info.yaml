abstract: COVID-19 is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities,
  including the deficiencies in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) and glutathione
  metabolism. Here it is investigated if administration of a mixture of combined metabolic
  activators (CMAs) consisting of glutathione and NAD+ precursors can restore metabolic
  function and thus aid the recovery of COVID-19 patients. CMAs include l-serine,
  N-acetyl-l-cysteine, nicotinamide riboside, and l-carnitine tartrate, salt form
  of l-carnitine. Placebo-controlled, open-label phase 2 study and double-blinded
  phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to investigate the time of symptom-free recovery
  on ambulatory patients using CMAs. The results of both studies show that the time
  to complete recovery is significantly shorter in the CMA group (6.6~vs 9.3 d) in
  phase 2 and (5.7~vs 9.2 d) in phase 3 trials compared to placebo group. A comprehensive
  analysis of the plasma metabolome and proteome reveals major metabolic changes.
  Plasma levels of proteins and metabolites associated with inflammation and antioxidant
  metabolism are significantly improved in patients treated with CMAs as compared
  to placebo. The results show that treating patients infected with COVID-19 with
  CMAs lead to a more rapid symptom-free recovery, suggesting a role for such a therapeutic
  regime in the treatment of infections leading to respiratory problems.
