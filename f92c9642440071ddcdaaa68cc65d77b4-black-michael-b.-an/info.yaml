abstract: A toxicogenomics approach was used to qualitatively and quantitatively compare
  the gene expression changes in human and rat primary hepatocytes exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
  (TCDD). Hepatocytes from five individual rats and five individual humans were exposed
  for 24 h to 11 concentrations of TCDD ranging from 0.00001 to 100nM and a vehicle
  control. Gene expression changes were analyzed using whole-genome microarrays containing
  13,002 orthologs. Significant changes in expression of individual orthologs at any
  concentration (fold change [FC] {$\pm$} 1.5 and false discovery rate {$<$} 0.05)
  were higher in the rat (1547) compared with human hepatocytes (475). Only 158 differentially
  expressed orthologs were common between rats and humans. Enrichment analysis was
  performed on the differentially expressed orthologs in each species with 49 and
  34 enriched human and rat pathways, respectively. Only 12 enriched pathways were
  shared between the two species. The results demonstrate significant cross-species
  differences in expression at both the gene and pathway level. Benchmark dose analysis
  of gene expression changes showed an average 18-fold cross-species difference in
  potency among differentially expressed orthologs with the rat more sensitive than
  the human. Similar cross-species differences in potency were observed for signaling
  pathways. Using the maximum FC in gene expression as a measure of efficacy, the
  human hepatocytes showed on average a 20\% lower efficacy among the individual orthologs
  showing differential expression. The results provide evidence for divergent cross-species
  gene expression changes in response to TCDD and are consistent with epidemiological
  and clinical evidence showing humans to be less sensitive to TCDD-induced hepatotoxicity.
