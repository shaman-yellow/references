abstract: '  Hardware-assisted trusted execution environments (TEEs) are critical
  building blocks of many modern applications. However, they have a one-way isolation
  model that introduces a semantic gap between a TEE and its outside world. This lack
  of information causes an ever-increasing set of attacks on TEE-enabled applications
  that exploit various insecure interactions with the host OSs, applications, or other
  enclaves. We introduce Sirius, the first compartmentalization framework that achieves
  strong isolation and secure sharing in TEE-assisted applications by controlling
  the dataflows within primary kernel objects (e.g. threads, processes, address spaces,
  files, sockets, pipes) in both the secure and normal worlds. Sirius replaces ad-hoc
  interactions in current TEE systems with a principled approach that adds strong
  inter- and intra-address space isolation and effectively eliminates a wide range
  of attacks. We evaluate Sirius on ARM platforms and find that it is lightweight
  ($\approx 15K$ LoC) and only adds $\approx 10.8\%$ overhead to enable TEE support
  on applications such as httpd, and improves the performance of existing TEE-enabled
  applications such as the Darknet ML framework and ARM''s LibDDSSec by $0.05\%-5.6\%$. '
