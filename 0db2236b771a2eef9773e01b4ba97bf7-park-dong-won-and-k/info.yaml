abstract: 'PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of serial
  lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) measurement on 28-day mortality prediction in patients
  with severe sepsis or septic shock admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU).
  METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of 74 ICU patients in a tertiary
  hospital. Serum LPC, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin (PCT)
  levels were measured at baseline (day 1 of enrollment) and day 7. The LPC concentrations
  were compared with inflammatory markers using their absolute levels and relative
  changes. RESULTS: The LPC concentration on day 7 was significantly lower in nonsurvivors
  than in survivors (68.45 {$\pm$} 42.36 {$\mu$}mol/L and 99.76 {$\pm$} 73.65 {$\mu$}mol/L;
  P = .04). A decreased LPC concentration on day 7 to its baseline as well as a sustained
  high concentration of PCT on day 7 at more than 50\% of its baseline value was useful
  for predicting the 28-day mortality. Prognostic utility was substantially improved
  when combined LPC and PCT criteria were applied to 28-day mortality outcome predictions.
  Furthermore, LPC concentrations increased over time in patients with appropriate
  antibiotics but not in those with inappropriate antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Serial
  measurements of LPC help in the prediction of 28-day mortality in ICU patients with
  severe sepsis or septic shock.'
