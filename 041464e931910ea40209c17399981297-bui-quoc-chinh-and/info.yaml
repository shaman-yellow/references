abstract: In this paper we present a biomedical event extraction system for the BioNLP
  2013 event extraction task. Our system consists of two phases. In the learning phase,
  a dictionary and patterns are generated automatically from annotated events. In
  the extraction phase, the dictionary and obtained patterns are applied to extract
  events from input text. When evaluated on the GENIA event extraction task of the
  BioNLP 2013 shared task, the system obtained the best results on strict matching
  and the third best on approximate span and recursive matching, with F-scores of
  48.92 and 50.68, respectively. Moreover, it has excellent performance in terms of
  speed.
