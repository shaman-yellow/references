abstract: Abstract             Identification of small molecules is a critical task
  in various areas of life science. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled
  the collection of tandem mass spectra of small molecules from hundreds of thousands
  of environments. To identify which molecules are present in a sample, one can search
  mass spectra collected from the sample against millions of molecular structures
  in small molecule databases. The existing approaches are based on chemistry domain
  knowledge, and they fail to explain many of the peaks in mass spectra of small molecules.
  Here, we present molDiscovery, a mass spectral database search method that improves
  both efficiency and accuracy of small molecule identification by learning a probabilistic
  model to match small molecules with their mass spectra. A search of over 8 million
  spectra from the Global Natural Product Social molecular networking infrastructure
  shows that molDiscovery correctly identify six times more unique small molecules
  than previous methods.
