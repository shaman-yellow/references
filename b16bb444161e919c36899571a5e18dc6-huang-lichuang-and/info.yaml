abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to
  cartilage destruction and bone erosion. In-depth exploration of the pathogenesis
  of RA and the development of effective therapeutic drugs are of important clinical
  and social value. Herein, we explored the medicinal value of Cornus officinalis
  Sieb. and Paeonia lactiflora Pall. in RA treatment using a rat model of collagen-induced
  arthritis (CIA). We compared the therapeutic effect of Cornus officinalis and Paeonia
  lactiflora with that of their main active compounds, ursolic acid and paeoniflorin,
  respectively. We demonstrated that the combination of Cornus officinalis and Paeonia
  lactiflora effectively inhibited the release of factors associated with oxidative
  stress and inflammation during RA, therein ameliorating the symptoms and suppressing
  the progression of RA. We further showed that the underlying mechanisms may be related
  to the regulation of apoptosis in synovial tissues, and we investigated the potential
  involvement of AMPK-mediated mitochondrial dynamics in the therapeutic action of
  the two drugs and their active components.
