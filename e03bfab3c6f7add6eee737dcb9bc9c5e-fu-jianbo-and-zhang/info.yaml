abstract: Individual variations in drug efficacy, side effects and adverse drug reactions
  are still challenging that cannot be ignored in drug research and development. The
  aim of pharmacometabonomics is to better understand the pharmacokinetic properties
  of drugs and monitor the drug effects on specific metabolic pathways. Here, we systematically
  reviewed the recent technological advances in pharmacometabonomics for better understanding
  the pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases as well as the metabolic effects of
  drugs on bodies. First, the advantages and disadvantages of all mainstream analytical
  techniques were compared. Second, many data processing strategies including filtering,
  missing value imputation, quality control-based correction, transformation, normalization
  together with the methods implemented in each step were discussed. Third, various
  feature selection and feature extraction algorithms commonly applied in pharmacometabonomics
  were described. Finally, the databases that facilitate current pharmacometabonomics
  were collected and discussed. All in all, this review provided guidance for researchers
  engaged in pharmacometabonomics and metabolomics, and it would promote the wide
  application of metabolomics in drug research and personalized medicine.
