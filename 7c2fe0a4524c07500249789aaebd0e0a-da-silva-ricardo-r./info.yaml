abstract: The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important
  steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations
  rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured
  way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments
  and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done
  through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and
  is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative
  approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the
  use of in silico predictions. One of the challenges of in silico annotation is the
  uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here
  we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of in silico
  predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no
  match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating
  a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network
  topology and structural similarity to improve in silico annotations. The Network
  Annotation Propagation (NAP) tool is accessible through the GNPS web-platform https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-theoretical.jsp.
