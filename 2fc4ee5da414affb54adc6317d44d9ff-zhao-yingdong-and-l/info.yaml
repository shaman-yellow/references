abstract: Abstract                            Background               In order to
  correctly decode phenotypic information from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, careful
  selection of the RNA-seq quantification measure is critical for inter-sample comparisons
  and for downstream analyses, such as differential gene expression between two or
  more conditions. Several methods have been proposed and continue to be used. However,
  a consensus has not been reached regarding the best gene expression quantification
  method for RNA-seq data analysis.                                         Methods               In
  the present study, we used replicate samples from each of 20 patient-derived xenograft
  (PDX) models spanning 15 tumor types, for a total of 61 human tumor xenograft samples
  available through the NCI patient-derived model repository (PDMR). We compared the
  reproducibility across replicate samples based on TPM (transcripts per million),
  FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped), and normalized
  counts using coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and cluster
  analysis.                                         Results               Our results
  revealed that hierarchical clustering on normalized count data tended to group replicate
  samples from the same PDX model together more accurately than TPM and FPKM data.
  Furthermore, normalized count data were observed to have the lowest median coefficient
  of variation (CV), and highest intraclass correlation (ICC) values across all replicate
  samples from the same model and for the same gene across all PDX models compared
  to TPM and FPKM data.                                         Conclusion               We
  provided compelling evidence for a preferred quantification measure to conduct downstream
  analyses of PDX RNA-seq data. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study
  of RNA-seq data quantification measures conducted on PDX models, which are known
  to be inherently more variable than cell line models. Our findings are consistent
  with what others have shown for human tumors and cell lines and add further support
  to the thesis that normalized counts are the best choice for the analysis of RNA-seq
  data across samples.
