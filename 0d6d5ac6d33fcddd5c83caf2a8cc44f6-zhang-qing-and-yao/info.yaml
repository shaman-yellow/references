abstract: As the major component of cell membranes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized
  de novo in the Kennedy pathway and then undergoes extensive deacylation-reacylation
  remodeling via Lands' cycle. The re-acylation is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase (LPCAT) and among the four LPCAT members in human, the LPCAT3 preferentially
  introduces polyunsaturated acyl onto the sn-2 position of lysophosphatidylcholine,
  thereby modulating the membrane fluidity and membrane protein functions therein.
  Combining the x-ray crystallography and the cryo-electron microscopy, we determined
  the structures of LPCAT3 in apo-, acyl donor-bound, and acyl receptor-bound states.
  A reaction chamber was revealed in the LPCAT3 structure where the lysophosphatidylcholine
  and arachidonoyl-CoA were positioned in two tunnels connected near to the catalytic
  center. A side pocket was found expanding the tunnel for the arachidonoyl CoA and
  holding the main body of arachidonoyl. The structural and functional analysis provides
  the basis for the re-acylation of lysophosphatidylcholine and the substrate preference
  during the reactions.
