abstract: Main risk factors of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include both genetic
  and non-genetic factors, especially prenatal and perinatal events. Newborn screening  dried
  blood spot (DBS) samples have great potential for the study of early  biochemical
  markers of disease. To study DBS strengths and limitations in the  context of ASD
  research, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of newborns later  diagnosed with
  ASD. We performed LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics on DBS  from 37 case-control
  pairs randomly selected from the iPSYCH sample. After  preprocessing using MZmine
  2.41, metabolites were putatively annotated using  mzCloud, GNPS feature-based molecular
  networking, and MolNetEnhancer. A total of  4360 mass spectral features were detected,
  of which 150 (113 unique) could be  putatively annotated at a high confidence level.
  Chemical structure information  at a broad level could be retrieved for 1009 metabolites,
  covering 31 chemical  classes. Although no clear distinction between cases and controls
  was revealed,  our method covered many metabolites previously associated with ASD,
  suggesting  that biochemical markers of ASD are present at birth and may be monitored
  during  newborn screening. Additionally, we observed that gestational age, age at  sampling,
  and month of birth influence the metabolomic profiles of newborn DBS,  which informs
  us on the important confounders to address in future studies.
