abstract: Liver X receptors {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} (LXR{$\alpha$} and LXR{$\beta$})
  are nuclear receptors with pivotal roles in the transcriptional control of lipid
  metabolism. Transcriptional activity of LXRs is induced in response to elevated
  cellular levels of cholesterol. LXRs bind to and regulate the expression of genes
  that encode proteins involved in cholesterol absorption, transport, efflux, excretion
  and conversion to bile acids. The coordinated, tissue-specific actions of the LXR
  pathway maintain systemic cholesterol homeostasis and regulate immune and inflammatory
  responses. LXRs also regulate fatty acid metabolism by controlling the lipogenic
  transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and regulate genes
  that encode proteins involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation. LXRs exert
  important effects on the metabolism of phospholipids, which, along with cholesterol,
  are major constituents of cellular membranes. LXR activation preferentially drives
  the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids by inducing
  transcription of the remodelling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase
  3. The ability of the LXR pathway to couple cellular sterol levels with the saturation
  of fatty acids in membrane phospholipids has implications for several physiological
  processes, including lipoprotein production, dietary lipid absorption and intestinal
  stem cell proliferation. Understanding how LXRs regulate membrane composition and
  function might provide new therapeutic insight into diseases associated with dysregulated
  lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and cancer.
