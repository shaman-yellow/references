abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Pharmacotranscriptomics\
  \ has become a powerful approach for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of drugs\
  \ and discovering new drug targets. Recently, studies of traditional Chinese medicine\
  \ (TCM) have increasingly turned to high-throughput transcriptomic screens for molecular\
  \ effects of herbs/ingredients. And numerous studies have examined gene targets\
  \ for herbs/ingredients, and link herbs/ingredients to various modern diseases.\
  \ However, there is currently no systematic database organizing these data for TCM.\
  \ Therefore, we built HERB, a high-throughput experiment- and reference-guided database\
  \ of TCM, with its Chinese name as BenCaoZuJian. We re-analyzed 6164 gene expression\
  \ profiles from 1037 high-throughput experiments evaluating TCM herbs/ingredients,\
  \ and generated connections between TCM herbs/ingredients and 2837 modern drugs\
  \ by mapping the comprehensive pharmacotranscriptomics dataset in HERB to CMap,\
  \ the largest such dataset for modern drugs. Moreover, we manually curated 1241\
  \ gene targets and 494 modern diseases for 473 herbs/ingredients from 1966 references\
  \ published recently, and cross-referenced this novel information to databases containing\
  \ such data for drugs. Together with database mining and statistical inference,\
  \ we linked 12 933 targets and 28 212 diseases to 7263 herbs and 49 258 ingredients\
  \ and provided six pairwise relationships among them in HERB. In summary, HERB will\
  \ intensively support the modernization of TCM and guide rational modern drug discovery\
  \ efforts. And it is accessible through http://herb.ac.cn/.</jats:p>"
