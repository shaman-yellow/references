abstract: Machine learning methods and in particular random forests are promising
  approaches for prediction based on high dimensional omics data sets. They provide
  variable importance measures to rank predictors according to their predictive power.
  If building a prediction model is the main goal of a study, often a minimal set
  of variables with good prediction performance is selected. However, if the objective
  is the identification of involved variables to find active networks and pathways,
  approaches that aim to select all relevant variables should be preferred. We evaluated
  several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly
  available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included
  the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a
  permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature
  elimination (RFE). {$\quad$}In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful
  approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar
  stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a
  pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis
  of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability
  in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta. In conclusion,
  we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional
  data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large
  data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings.
