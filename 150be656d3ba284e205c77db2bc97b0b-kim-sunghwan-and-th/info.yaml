abstract: PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is a public repository for information
  on chemical substances and their biological activities, launched in 2004 as a component
  of the Molecular Libraries Roadmap Initiatives of the US National Institutes of
  Health (NIH). For the past 11 years, PubChem has grown to a sizable system, serving
  as a chemical information resource for the scientific research community. PubChem
  consists of three inter-linked databases, Substance, Compound and BioAssay. The
  Substance database contains chemical information deposited by individual data contributors
  to PubChem, and the Compound database stores unique chemical structures extracted
  from the Substance database. Biological activity data of chemical substances tested
  in assay experiments are contained in the BioAssay database. This paper provides
  an overview of the PubChem Substance and Compound databases, including data sources
  and contents, data organization, data submission using PubChem Upload, chemical
  structure standardization, web-based interfaces for textual and non-textual searches,
  and programmatic access. It also gives a brief description of PubChem3D, a resource
  derived from theoretical three-dimensional structures of compounds in PubChem, as
  well as PubChemRDF, Resource Description Framework (RDF)-formatted PubChem data
  for data sharing, analysis and integration with information contained in other databases.
