abstract: We present a deep clustering-based MS data visualization strategy (MCnebula),
  integrated with the influential open-source automatic MS annotation platform SIRIUS
  and               in vivo               and               in vitro               methods,
  to screen and validate potential lead compounds from natural products.                        ,                             Natural
  products have been a key source of drug lead discovery. However, their identification
  has long been a challenge even with the state-of-the-art analysis technologies like
  high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) due to their complexity. Emerging               in
  silico               chemical structure prediction tools have provided time-saving
  and highly efficient approaches for identification of these complex samples. Nevertheless,
  the interpretation of these MS annotations into key supporting evidence towards
  specific questions is still a bottleneck in medicinal and biological fields. Here
  we present a deep clustering-based MS data visualization strategy (MCnebula), integrated
  with the influential open-source automatic MS annotation platform SIRIUS and               in
  vivo               and               in vitro               methods, to screen and
  validate potential lead compounds from natural products. MCnebula could provide
  multi-layer clustering profiles with chemical ontologies and comparative analysis
  of differential treatments. Plantaginis Semen (PS) is commonly used for treating
  kidney disease and usually stir-fried with salt water to enhance its anti-renal
  fibrosis effect, but the reason behind this remains unclear. Taking PS as an example,
  we comprehensively identified and compared the raw and processed PS extracts with
  SIRIUS-MCnebula, and screened potential anti-renal fibrotic lead compounds using
  weighted fold change analysis. Eighty-nine components were identified in PS with
  isoacteoside, calceolarioside B, 2{${'}$}-acetylacteoside, and plantainoside D being
  screened and validated to treat renal fibrosis. The novel developed mass spectral
  data visualization strategy combined with biological function investigation and
  validation workflow could not only accelerate the discovery of lead compounds from
  medicinal natural products, but also shed new light on the traditional processing
  theory.
