abstract: Metabolite identification for untargeted metabolomics is often hampered
  by the lack of experimentally collected reference spectra from tandem mass spectrometry
  (MS/MS). To circumvent this problem, Competitive Fragmentation Modeling-ID (CFM-ID)
  was developed to accurately predict electrospray ionization-MS/MS (ESI-MS/MS) spectra
  from chemical structures and to aid in compound identification via MS/MS spectral
  matching. While earlier versions of CFM-ID performed very well, CFM-ID's performance
  for predicting the MS/MS spectra of certain classes of compounds, including many
  lipids, was quite poor. Furthermore, CFM-ID's compound identification capabilities
  were limited because it did not use experimentally available MS/MS spectra nor did
  it exploit metadata in its spectral matching algorithm. Here, we describe significant
  improvements to CFM-ID's performance and speed. These include (1) the implementation
  of a rule-based fragmentation approach for lipid MS/MS spectral prediction, which
  greatly improves the speed and accuracy of CFM-ID; (2) the inclusion of experimental
  MS/MS spectra and other metadata to enhance CFM-ID's compound identification abilities;
  (3) the development of new scoring functions that improves CFM-ID's accuracy by
  21.1\%; and (4) the implementation of a chemical classification algorithm that correctly
  classifies unknown chemicals (based on their MS/MS spectra) in {$>$}80\% of the
  cases. This improved version called CFM-ID 3.0 is freely available as a web server.
  Its source code is also accessible online.
