abstract: We present elPrep 5, which updates the elPrep framework for processing sequencing
  alignment/map files with variant calling. elPrep 5 can now execute the full pipeline
  described by the GATK Best Practices for variant calling, which consists of PCR
  and optical duplicate marking, sorting by coordinate order, base quality score recalibration,
  and variant calling using the haplotype caller algorithm. elPrep 5 produces identical
  BAM and VCF output as GATK4 while significantly reducing the runtime by parallelizing
  and merging the execution of the pipeline steps. Our benchmarks show that elPrep
  5 speeds up the runtime of the variant calling pipeline by a factor 8-16x on both
  whole-exome and whole-genome data while using the same hardware resources as GATK4.
  This makes elPrep 5 a suitable drop-in replacement for GATK4 when faster execution
  times are needed.
