abstract: Abstract                            Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents have transformed
  the treatment landscape of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To expand
  our understanding of the molecular features underlying response to checkpoint inhibitors
  in NSCLC, we describe here the first joint analysis of the Stand Up To Cancer-Mark
  Foundation cohort, a resource of whole exome and/or RNA sequencing from 393 patients
  with NSCLC treated with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, along with matched clinical response
  annotation. We identify a number of associations between molecular features and
  outcome, including (1) favorable (for example,               ATM               altered)
  and unfavorable (for example,               TERT               amplified) genomic
  subgroups, (2) a prominent association between expression of inducible components
  of the immunoproteasome and response and (3) a dedifferentiated tumor-intrinsic
  subtype with enhanced response to checkpoint blockade. Taken together, results from
  this cohort demonstrate the complexity of biological determinants underlying immunotherapy
  outcomes and reinforce the discovery potential of integrative analysis within large,
  well-curated, cancer-specific cohorts.
