abstract: 'BACKGROUND: A number of computational tools for metabolism prediction have
  been developed over the last 20~years to predict the structures of small molecules
  undergoing biological transformation or environmental degradation. These tools were
  largely developed to facilitate absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion,
  and toxicity (ADMET) studies, although there is now a growing interest in using
  such tools to facilitate metabolomics and exposomics studies. However, their use
  and widespread adoption is still hampered by several factors, including their limited
  scope, breath of coverage, availability, and performance. RESULTS: To address these
  limitations, we have developed BioTransformer, a freely available software package
  for accurate, rapid, and comprehensive in silico metabolism prediction and compound
  identification. BioTransformer combines a machine learning approach with a knowledge-based
  approach to predict small molecule metabolism in human tissues (e.g. liver tissue),
  the human gut as well as the environment (soil and water microbiota), via its metabolism
  prediction tool. A comprehensive evaluation of BioTransformer showed that it was
  able to outperform two state-of-the-art commercially available tools (Meteor Nexus
  and ADMET Predictor), with precision and recall values up to 7 times better than
  those obtained for Meteor Nexus or ADMET Predictor on the same sets of pharmaceuticals,
  pesticides, phytochemicals or endobiotics under similar or identical constraints.
  Furthermore BioTransformer was able to reproduce 100\% of the transformations and
  metabolites predicted by the EAWAG pathway prediction system. Using mass spectrometry
  data obtained from a rat experimental study with epicatechin supplementation, BioTransformer
  was also able to correctly identify 39 previously reported epicatechin metabolites
  via its metabolism identification tool, and suggest 28 potential metabolites, 17
  of which matched nine monoisotopic masses for which no evidence of a previous report
  could be found. CONCLUSION: BioTransformer can be used as an open access command-line
  tool, or a software library. It is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/djoumbou/biotransformerjar/
  . Moreover, it is also freely available as an open access RESTful application at
  www.biotransformer.ca , which allows users to manually or programmatically submit
  queries, and retrieve metabolism predictions or compound identification data.'
