abstract: It is well documented that patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
  have distinct susceptibility to the different biologic DMARDs available on the market,
  probably because of the many facets of the disease. Monocytes are deeply involved
  in the pathogenesis of RA and we therefore evaluated and compared the transcriptomic
  profile of monocytes isolated from patients on treatment with methotrexate alone
  or in combination with tocilizumab, anti-TNF{$\alpha$} or abatacept and from healthy
  donors. Whole-genome transcriptomics yielded a list of regulated genes by Rank Product
  statistics and DAVID was then used for functional annotation enrichment analysis.
  Last, data were validated by qRT-PCR. Abatacept, tocilizumab and anti-TNFa cohorts
  were separately compared with methotrexate, leading to the identification of 78,
  6, and 436 differentially expressed genes, respectively. The upper-most ranked genes
  were related to inflammatory processes and immune responses. Such an approach draws
  the genomic profile of monocytes in treated RA patients and lays the basis for finding
  gene signature for tailored therapeutic choices.
