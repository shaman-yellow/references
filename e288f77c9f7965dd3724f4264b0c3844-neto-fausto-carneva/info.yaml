abstract: The urine metabolome constitutes a rich source of functional information
  reflecting physiological states that are influenced by distinct conditions and  biological
  stresses, such as responses to drug treatments or disease  manifestations. Although
  global liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)  profiling provides the most
  comprehensive measurement of metabolites in complex  biological samples, annotation
  remains a challenge, and computational approaches  are necessary to translate the
  molecular composition into biological knowledge.  Here, we investigated the use
  of tandem MS-based enhanced molecular networks  (MolNetEnhancer) to improve the
  metabolite annotation of urine extracts. The  samples (n = 10) were analyzed by
  hydrophilic interaction  chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
  in both electrospray  ionization (ESI) modes. Consistent with other common data
  preprocessing software,  the use of Progenesis QI led to the annotation of up to
  20 metabolites based on  MS2 library searches, showing a high fragmentation score
  (cosine similarity {$\geq$}  0.7), that is, {$\sim$}2\% of mass features containing
  MS2 spectra. Molecular networking  based on library matching resulted in the annotation
  of up to 62 urinary  compounds. Using a combination of unsupervised substructure
  discovery (MS2LDA),  the in silico tool network annotation propagation (NAP), and
  ClassyFire chemical  ontology, embedded in a multilayered molecular network by MolNetEnhancer,
  we were  able to expand the chemical characterization to {$\sim$}50\% of the data
  set. The  integrative approach led to the annotation of 275 compounds at the metabolomics  standards
  initiative (MSI) confidence level 2, as well as 459 and 578 urinary  metabolites
  (MSI level 3) in both negative and positive ESI modes, respectively.  The exhaustive
  MS2-based annotation outperformed similar studies applied to  larger cohorts while
  offering the discovery of metabolites not identified by the  MS2 library search.
  This is the first work that effectively integrates orthogonal  annotation methods
  and MS2-based fragmentation studies to improve metabolite  annotation in urine samples.
