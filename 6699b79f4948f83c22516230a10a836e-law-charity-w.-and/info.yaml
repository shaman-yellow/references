abstract: Differential expression analysis of genomic data types, such as RNA-sequencing
  experiments, use linear models to determine the size and direction of the changes
  in gene expression. For RNA-sequencing, there are several established software packages
  for this purpose accompanied with analysis pipelines that are well described. However,
  there are two crucial steps in the analysis process that can be a stumbling block
  for many -- the set up an appropriate model via design matrices and the set up of
  comparisons of interest via contrast matrices. These steps are particularly troublesome
  because an extensive catalogue for design and contrast matrices does not currently
  exist. One would usually search for example case studies across different platforms
  and mix and match the advice from those sources to suit the dataset they have at
  hand. This article guides the reader through the basics of how to set up design
  and contrast matrices. We take a practical approach by providing code and graphical
  representation of each case study, starting with simpler examples (e.g. models with
  a single explanatory variable) and move onto more complex ones (e.g. interaction
  models, mixed effects models, higher order time series and cyclical models). Although
  our work has been written specifically with a               limma               -style
  pipeline in mind, most of it is also applicable to other software packages for differential
  expression analysis, and the ideas covered can be adapted to data analysis of other
  high-throughput technologies. Where appropriate, we explain the interpretation and
  differences between models to aid readers in their own model choices. Unnecessary
  jargon and theory is omitted where possible so that our work is accessible to a
  wide audience of readers, from beginners to those with experience in genomics data
  analysis.
