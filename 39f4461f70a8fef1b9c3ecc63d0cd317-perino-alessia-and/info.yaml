abstract: Over the past two decades, bile acids (BAs) have become established as important
  signaling molecules that enable fine-tuned inter-tissue communication from the liver,
  their site of production, over the intestine, where they are modified by the gut
  microbiota, to virtually any organ, where they exert their pleiotropic physiological
  effects. The chemical variety of BAs, to a large extent determined by the gut microbiome,
  also allows for a complex fine-tuning of adaptive responses in our body. This review
  provides an overview of the mechanisms by which BA receptors coordinate several
  aspects of physiology and highlights new therapeutic strategies for diseases underlying
  pathological BA signaling.
