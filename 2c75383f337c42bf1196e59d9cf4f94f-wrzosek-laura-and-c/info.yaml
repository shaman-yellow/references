abstract: Objective               Chronic alcohol consumption is an important cause
  of liver-related deaths. Specific intestinal microbiota profiles are associated
  with susceptibility or resistance to alcoholic liver disease in both mice and humans.
  We aimed to identify the mechanisms by which targeting intestinal microbiota can
  improve alcohol-induced liver lesions.                                         Design               We
  used human associated mice, a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease transplanted
  with the intestinal microbiota of alcoholic patients and used the prebiotic, pectin,
  to modulate the intestinal microbiota. Based on metabolomic analyses, we focused
  on microbiota tryptophan metabolites, which are ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR). Involvement of the AhR pathway was assessed using both a pharmacological
  approach and AhR-deficient mice.                                         Results                                Pectin
  treatment modified the microbiome and metabolome in human microbiota-associated
  alcohol-fed mice, leading to a specific faecal signature. High production of bacterial
  tryptophan metabolites was associated with an improvement of liver injury. The AhR
  agonist Ficz (6-formylindolo (3,2-b) carbazole) reduced liver lesions, similarly
  to prebiotic treatment. Conversely, inactivation of the                 ahr                 gene
  in alcohol-fed AhR                 knock-out                 mice abrogated the
  beneficial effects of the prebiotic. Importantly, patients with severe alcoholic
  hepatitis have low levels of bacterial tryptophan derivatives that are AhR agonists.                                                        Conclusions               Improvement
  of alcoholic liver disease by targeting the intestinal microbiota involves the AhR
  pathway, which should be considered as a new therapeutic target.
