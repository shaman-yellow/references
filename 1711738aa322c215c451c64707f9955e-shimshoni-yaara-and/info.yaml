abstract: 'The goal of this study is to integrate two areas in recent clinical theory,
  research, and practice: family accommodation and non-violent resistance (NVR). Family
  accommodation describes changes that family members make to their own behavior,
  to help their relative who is dealing with psychopathology to avoid or alleviate
  distress related to the disorder. Rapidly growing research on family accommodation
  has established its high prevalence and negative impact across disorders and the
  life span. NVR is a trans-diagnostic treatment approach that helps parents to cope
  with child externalizing, internalizing, and other problems in non-escalatory ways.
  This study reviews empirical research on family accommodation and NVR, and argues
  that the anchoring function of NVR, a central concept reflecting the stabilization
  of the parent-child relationship, may provide a uniquely suited framework for reducing
  family accommodation across disorders and development. The study discusses how the
  anchoring function may be applied to promote accommodation reduction through a detailed
  description of SPACE (Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions), an NVR-informed
  treatment for childhood anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.'
