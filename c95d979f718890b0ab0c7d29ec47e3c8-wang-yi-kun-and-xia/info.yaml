abstract: Medicinal plants are complex chemical systems containing thousands of secondary
  metabolites. The rapid classification and characterization of the components in  medicinal
  plants using mass spectrometry (MS) remains an immense challenge.  Herein, a novel
  strategy is presented for MS through the combination of  solid-phase extraction
  (SPE), multiple mass defect filtering (MMDF) and molecular  networking (MN). This
  strategy enables efficient classification and annotation of  natural products. When
  combined with SPE and MMDF, the improved analytical method  of MN can perform the
  rapid annotation of diverse natural products in Citrus  aurantium according to the
  tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragments. In MN,  MS2LDA can be initially applied
  to recognize substructures of natural products,  according to the common fragmentation
  patterns and neutral losses in multiple  MS/MS spectra. MolNetEnhancer was adopted
  here to obtain chemical classifications  provided by ClassyFire. The results suggest
  that the integrated SPE-MMDF-MN  method was capable of rapidly annotating a greater
  number of natural products  from Citrus aurantium than the classical MN strategy
  alone. Moreover, SPE and  MMDF enhanced the effectiveness of MN for annotating,
  classifying and  distinguishing different types of natural products. Our workflow
  provides the  foundation for the automated, high-throughput structural classification
  and  annotation of secondary metabolites with various chemical structures. The  developed
  approach can be widely applied in the analysis of constituents in  natural products.
