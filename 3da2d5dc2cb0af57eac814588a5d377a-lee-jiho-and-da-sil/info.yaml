abstract: In liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics, data matrices
  with up to thousands of variables for each ion peak are subjected to multivariate  analysis
  (MVA) to assess the homogeneity between samples. The large dimensions of  LC/MS
  datasets hinder the identification of the discriminant or the metabolic  markers.
  In the present study, the molecular network (MN) approach and two in  silico annotation
  tools, network annotation propagation (NAP) and the  hierarchical chemical classification
  method, ClassyFire, were used to annotate  the metabolites of three Zanthoxylum
  species, Z. bungeanum, Z. schinifolium and  Z. piperitum. The in silico annotation
  results of the MN nodes and the MVA  variables were combined and visualized in loading
  plots. This approach helped  intuitive detection of the variables that greatly contributed
  to the separation  of the samples in the score plot as discriminant or metabolic
  markers, thereby  allowing rapid annotation of two flavanone derivatives.
