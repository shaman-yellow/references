abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A large amount of sequencing data
  is generated and processed every day with the continuous evolution of sequencing
  technology and the expansion of sequencing applications. One consequence of such
  sequencing data explosion is the increasing cost and complexity of data processing.
  The preprocessing of FASTQ data, which means removing adapter contamination, filtering
  low‐quality reads, and correcting wrongly represented bases, is an indispensable
  but resource intensive part of sequencing data analysis. Therefore, although a lot
  of software applications have been developed to solve this problem, bioinformatics
  scientists and engineers are still pursuing faster, simpler, and more energy‐efficient
  software. Several years ago, the author developed fastp, which is an ultrafast all‐in‐one
  FASTQ data preprocessor with many modern features. This software has been approved
  by many bioinformatics users and has been continuously maintained and updated. Since
  the first publication on fastp, it has been greatly improved, making it even faster
  and more powerful. For instance, the duplication evaluation module has been improved,
  and a new deduplication module has been added. This study aimed to introduce the
  new features of fastp and demonstrate how it was designed and implemented.</jats:p>
