abstract: 'Motivation: Metabolomics has shown great potential to improve the understanding
  of complex diseases, potentially leading to therapeutic target identification. However,
  no single analytical method allows monitoring all metabolites in a sample, resulting
  in incomplete metabolic fingerprints. This incompleteness constitutes a stumbling
  block to interpretation, raising the need for methods that can enrich those fingerprints.
  We propose MetaboRank, a new solution inspired by social network recommendation
  systems for the identification of metabolites potentially related to a metabolic
  fingerprint. Results: MetaboRank method had been used to enrich metabolomics data
  obtained on cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients suffering from hepatic encephalopathy
  (HE). MetaboRank successfully recommended metabolites not present in the original
  fingerprint. The quality of recommendations was evaluated by using literature automatic
  search, in order to check that recommended metabolites could be related to the disease.
  Complementary mass spectrometry experiments and raw data analysis were performed
  to confirm these suggestions. In particular, MetaboRank recommended the overlooked
  {$\alpha$}-ketoglutaramate as a metabolite which should be added to the metabolic
  fingerprint of HE, thus suggesting that metabolic fingerprints enhancement can provide
  new insight on complex diseases. Availability and implementation: Method is implemented
  in the MetExplore server and is available at www.metexplore.fr. A tutorial is available
  at https://metexplore.toulouse.inra.fr/com/tutorials/MetaboRank/2017-MetaboRank.pdf.
  Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.'
