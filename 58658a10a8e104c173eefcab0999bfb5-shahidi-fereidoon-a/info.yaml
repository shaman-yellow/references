abstract: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) include {$\alpha$}-linolenic
  acid (ALA; 18:3 {$\omega$}-3), stearidonic acid (SDA; 18:4 {$\omega$}-3), eicosapentaenoic
  acid (EPA; 20:5 {$\omega$}-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5 {$\omega$}-3), and
  docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 {$\omega$}-3). In the past few decades, many epidemiological
  studies have been conducted on the myriad health benefits of omega-3 PUFAs. In this
  review, we summarized the structural features, properties, dietary sources, metabolism,
  and bioavailability of omega-3 PUFAs and their effects on cardiovascular disease,
  diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, depression, visual and neurological
  development, and maternal and child health. Even though many health benefits of
  omega-3 PUFAs have been reported in the literature, there are also some controversies
  about their efficacy and certain benefits to human health.
