abstract: <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Scalable, integrative methods to
  understand mechanisms that link genetic variants with phenotypes are needed. Here
  we derive a mathematical expression to compute PrediXcan (a gene mapping approach)
  results using summary data (S-PrediXcan) and show its accuracy and general robustness
  to misspecified reference sets. We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+
  phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog
  of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on
  human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations
  are tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized
  significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic
  scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory
  mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations
  for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause
  a spectrum of milder phenotypes.</jats:p>
