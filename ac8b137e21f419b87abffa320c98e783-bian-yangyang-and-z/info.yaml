abstract: Abstract             Nano-flow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
  (nano-flow LC\textendash MS/MS) is the mainstay in proteome research because of
  its excellent sensitivity but often comes at the expense of robustness. Here we
  show that micro-flow LC\textendash MS/MS using a 1\,\texttimes\,150\,mm column shows
  excellent reproducibility of chromatographic retention time ({$<$}0.3\% coefficient
  of variation, CV) and protein quantification ({$<$}7.5\% CV) using data from {$>$}2000
  samples of human cell lines, tissues and body fluids. Deep proteome analysis identifies
  {$>$}9000 proteins and {$>$}120,000 peptides in 16\,h and sample multiplexing using
  tandem mass tags increases throughput to 11 proteomes in 16\,h. The system identifies
  {$>$}30,000 phosphopeptides in 12\,h and protein-protein or protein-drug interaction
  experiments can be analyzed in 20\,min per sample. We show that the same column
  can be used to analyze {$>$}7500 samples without apparent loss of performance. This
  study demonstrates that micro-flow LC\textendash MS/MS is suitable for a broad range
  of proteomic applications.
