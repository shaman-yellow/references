abstract: Liquid chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) has been widely used in
  natural product analysis. Global detection and identification of nontargeted components
  are desirable in natural product research, for example, in quality control of Chinese
  herbal medicine. Nontargeted components analysis continues to expand to exciting
  life science application domains such as metabonomics. With this background, the
  present review summarizes recent developments in the analysis of minor unknown natural
  products using LC-MS and mainly focuses on the determination of the molecular formulae,
  selection of precursor ions, and characteristic fragmentation patterns of the known
  compounds. This review consists of three parts. Firstly, the methods used to determine
  unique molecular formula of unknown compounds such as accurate mass measurements,
  MSn spectra, or relative isotopic abundance information, are introduced. Secondly,
  the methods improving signal-to-noise ratio of MS/MS spectra by manual-MS/MS or
  workflow targeting-only signals were elucidated; pure precursor ions can be selected
  by changing the precursor ion isolated window. Lastly, characteristic fragmentation
  patterns such as Retro-Diels-Alder (RDA), McLafferty rearrangements, "internal residue
  loss," and so on, occurring in the molecular ions of natural products are summarized.
  Classical application of characteristic fragmentation patterns in identifying unknown
  compounds in extracts and relevant fragmentation mechanisms are presented (RDA reactions
  occurring readily in the molecular ions of flavanones or isoflavanones, McLafferty-type
  fragmentation reactions of some natural products such as epipolythiodioxopiperazines;
  fragmentation by "internal residue loss" possibly involving ion-neutral complex
  intermediates). \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Mass Spec Rev 37:202-216,
