abstract: Abstract                        Metabolomics has started to embrace computational
  approaches for chemical interpretation of large data sets. Yet, metabolite annotation
  remains a key challenge. Recently, molecular networking and MS2LDA emerged as molecular
  mining tools that find molecular families and substructures in mass spectrometry
  fragmentation data. Moreover,             in silico             annotation tools
  obtain and rank candidate molecules for fragmentation spectra. Ideally, all structural
  information obtained and inferred from these computational tools could be combined
  to increase the resulting chemical insight one can obtain from a data set. However,
  integration is currently hampered as each tool has its own output format and efficient
  matching of data across these tools is lacking. Here, we introduce MolNetEnhancer,
  a workflow that combines the outputs from molecular networking, MS2LDA,             in
  silico             annotation tools (such as Network Annotation Propagation or DEREPLICATOR)
  and the automated chemical classification through ClassyFire to provide a more comprehensive
  chemical overview of metabolomics data whilst at the same time illuminating structural
  details for each fragmentation spectrum. We present examples from four plant and
  bacterial case studies and show how MolNetEnhancer enables the chemical annotation,
  visualization, and discovery of the subtle substructural diversity within molecular
  families. We conclude that MolNetEnhancer is a useful tool that greatly assists
  the metabolomics researcher in deciphering the metabolome through combination of
  multiple independent             in silico             pipelines.
