abstract: Abstract                            Neuroblastoma, the most frequent solid
  tumor in infants, shows very diverse outcomes from spontaneous regression to fatal
  disease. When these different tumors originate and how they evolve are not known.
  Here we quantify the somatic evolution of neuroblastoma by deep whole-genome sequencing,
  molecular clock analysis and population-genetic modeling in a comprehensive cohort
  covering all subtypes. We find that tumors across the entire clinical spectrum begin
  to develop via aberrant mitoses as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Neuroblastomas
  with favorable prognosis expand clonally after short evolution, whereas aggressive
  neuroblastomas show prolonged evolution during which they acquire telomere maintenance
  mechanisms. The initial aneuploidization events condition subsequent evolution,
  with aggressive neuroblastoma exhibiting early genomic instability. We find in the
  discovery cohort (               n               \,=\,100), and validate in an independent
  cohort (               n               \,=\,86), that the duration of evolution
  is an accurate predictor of outcome. Thus, insight into neuroblastoma evolution
  may prospectively guide treatment decisions.
