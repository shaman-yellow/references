abstract: Urine metabolites are used in many clinical and biomedical studies but usually
  only for a few classic compounds. Metabolomics detects vastly more metabolic  signals
  that may be used to precisely define the health status of individuals.  However,
  many compounds remain unidentified, hampering biochemical conclusions.  Here, we
  annotate all metabolites detected by two untargeted metabolomic assays,  hydrophilic
  interaction chromatography (HILIC)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry  and charged
  surface hybrid (CSH)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry. Over 9,000  unique metabolite
  signals were detected, of which 42\% triggered MS/MS  fragmentations in data-dependent
  mode. On the highest Metabolomics Standards  Initiative (MSI) confidence level 1,
  we identified 175 compounds using authentic  standards with precursor mass, retention
  time, and MS/MS matching. An additional  578 compounds were annotated by precursor
  accurate mass and MS/MS matching alone,  MSI level 2, including a novel library
  specifically geared at acylcarnitines  (CarniBlast). The rest of the metabolome
  is usually left unannotated. To fill  this gap, we used the in silico fragmentation
  tool CSI:FingerID and the new NIST  hybrid search to annotate all further compounds
  (MSI level 3). Testing the  top-ranked metabolites in CSI:Finger ID annotations
  yielded 40\% accuracy when  applied to the MSI level 1 identified compounds. We
  classified all MSI level 3  annotations by the NIST hybrid search using the ClassyFire
  ontology into 21  superclasses that were further distinguished into 184 chemical
  classes.  ClassyFire annotations showed that the previously unannotated urine metabolome  consists
  of 28\% derivatives of organic acids, 16\% heterocyclics, and 16\% lipids  as major
  classes.
