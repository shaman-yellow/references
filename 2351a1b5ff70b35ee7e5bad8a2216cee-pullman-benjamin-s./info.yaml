abstract: High-throughput tandem mass spectrometry has enabled the detection and identification
  of over 75\% of all proteins predicted to result in translated gene products in
  the human genome. In fact, the galloping rate of data acquisition and sharing of
  mass spectrometry data has led to the current availability of many tens of terabytes
  of public data in thousands of human data sets. The systematic reanalysis of these
  public data sets has been used to build a community-scale spectral library of 2.1
  million precursors for over 1 million unique sequences from over 19,000 proteins
  (including spectra of synthetic peptides). However, it has remained challenging
  to find and inspect spectra of peptides covering functional protein regions or matching
  novel proteins. ProteinExplorer addresses these challenges with an intuitive interface
  mapping tens of millions of identifications to functional sites on nearly all human
  proteins while maintaining provenance for every identification back to the original
  data set and data file. Additionally, ProteinExplorer facilitates the selection
  and inspection of HPP-compliant peptides whose spectra can be matched to spectra
  of synthetic peptides and already includes HPP-compliant evidence for 107 missing
  (PE2, PE3, and PE4) and 23 dubious (PE5) proteins. Finally, ProteinExplorer allows
  users to rate spectra and to contribute to a community library of peptides entitled
  PrEdict (Protein Existance dictionary) mapping to novel proteins but whose preliminary
  identities have not yet been fully established with community-scale false discovery
  rates and synthetic peptide spectra. ProteinExplorer can be now be accessed at https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/protein\_explorer\_splash.jsp
