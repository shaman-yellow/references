abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Urban pests pose enormous risks to human health. Control
  initiatives are carried out in regions of high infestation and incidence of  accidents
  caused by scorpions OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to analyze the  anti-scorpionic
  activity of fungal isolates obtained from a cemetery in Brazil.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:
  A total of thirteen fungi were subjected to a bioassay  test against Tityus serrulatus,
  and the two isolates with the highest  scorpionicidal activity were selected for
  molecular identification through  sequencing of the ITS DNA hypervariable region
  and large-scale cultivation on  liquid medium for secondary metabolite extraction.
  The crude extracts were  partitioned by solid-phase extraction, and the resulting
  purified extracts were  tested for anti-scorpionic activity. The extracts from one
  of the isolates  presented better results and were submitted to UPLC-MS/MS. The
  metabolomics data  were submitted to GNPS website for Molecular Networking and MASST
  searches. We  also performed a MolNetEnhancer analysis to identify the chemical
  classes of the  molecules found in the samples. RESULTS: The most promising fungal
  isolate was  identified as Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 which has 98\% of similarity
  to  Paecilomyces formosus. The sub-fractions C and D had the best activity against  the
  scorpions (54 and 32\% mortality, respectively). Molecular Networking and  MolNetEnhancer
  revealed a range of molecular classes in our extracts that are  known to include
  bioactive metabolites from Paecilomyces species. CONCLUSIONS:  The scorpionicidal
  activity of Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 and its secondary  metabolites may provide
  new alternative compounds for biological and chemical  control of scorpions from
  the species T. serrulatus. Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 is  an isolate that has great
  potential for isolation of secondary metabolites.'
