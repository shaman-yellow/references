abstract: Abstract                            Mechanisms underpinning the dysfunctional
  immune response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection are
  elusive. We analyzed single-cell transcriptomes and T and B cell receptors (BCR)
  of {$>$}895,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 73 coronavirus disease 2019
  (COVID-19) patients and 75 healthy controls of Japanese ancestry with host genetic
  data. COVID-19 patients showed a low fraction of nonclassical monocytes (ncMono).
  We report downregulated cell transitions from classical monocytes to ncMono in COVID-19
  with reduced               CXCL10               expression in ncMono in severe disease.
  Cell\textendash cell communication analysis inferred decreased cellular interactions
  involving ncMono in severe COVID-19. Clonal expansions of BCR were evident in the
  plasmablasts of patients. Putative disease genes identified by COVID-19 genome-wide
  association study showed cell type-specific expressions in monocytes and dendritic
  cells. A COVID-19-associated risk variant at the               IFNAR2               locus
  (rs13050728) had context-specific and monocyte-specific expression quantitative
  trait loci effects. Our study highlights biological and host genetic involvement
  of innate immune cells in COVID-19 severity.
