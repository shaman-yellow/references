abstract: Abstract             Phylogenetics has a crucial role in genomic epidemiology.
  Enabled by unparalleled volumes of genome sequence data generated to study and help
  contain the COVID-19 pandemic, phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have
  shed light on the virus's origins, spread, and the emergence and reproductive success
  of new variants. However, most phylogenetic approaches, including maximum likelihood
  and Bayesian methods, cannot scale to the size of the datasets from the current
  pandemic. We present `MAximum Parsimonious Likelihood Estimation' (MAPLE), an approach
  for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis of epidemiological genomic datasets at
  unprecedented scales. MAPLE infers SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies more accurately than existing
  maximum likelihood approaches while running up to thousands of times faster, and
  requiring at least 100 times less memory on large datasets. This extends the reach
  of genomic epidemiology, allowing the continued use of accurate phylogenetic, phylogeographic
  and phylodynamic analyses on datasets of millions of genomes.
