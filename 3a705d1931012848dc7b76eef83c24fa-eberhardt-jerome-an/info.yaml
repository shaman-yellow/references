abstract: AutoDock Vina is arguably one of the fastest and most widely used open-source
  programs for molecular docking. However, compared to other programs in the AutoDock
  Suite, it lacks support for modeling specific features such as macrocycles or explicit
  water molecules. Here, we describe the implementation of this functionality in AutoDock
  Vina 1.2.0. Additionally, AutoDock Vina 1.2.0 supports the AutoDock4.2 scoring function,
  simultaneous docking of multiple ligands, and a batch mode for docking a large number
  of ligands. Furthermore, we implemented Python bindings to facilitate scripting
  and the development of docking workflows. This work is an effort toward the unification
  of the features of the AutoDock4 and AutoDock Vina programs. The source code is
  available at https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-Vina.
