abstract: Dysrhythmia associated with reperfusion may not only play a critical role
  in sudden cardiac death, but also, the presence of dysrhythmia during intracoronary
  administration of thrombolytic agents may reflect heterogeneity of recovery of excitability
  and, hence, salvage of ischemic myocardium. The electrophysiologic basis for these
  dysrhythmias appears to be heterogeneity of electrical recovery resulting in reentry
  or enhanced ventricular automaticity. Although the precise mechanisms are unknown,
  rapid changes in K+, PCO2 and intracellular Ca++ appear to play major roles. In
  addition, alterations in the regional concentration or tissue compartment localization
  of amphiphilic lipid metabolites such as lysophosphoglycerides and long-chain acyl
  carnitines may affect not only the development of dysrhythmia during reperfusion,
  but also the salvage of ischemic myocardium. Recent experimental evidence in several
  species also suggests a prominent role of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the
  evolution of dysrhythmia associated with reperfusion.
