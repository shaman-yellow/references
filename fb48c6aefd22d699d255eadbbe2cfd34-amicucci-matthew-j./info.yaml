abstract: Abstract             Polysaccharides are the most abundant biomolecules
  in nature, but are the least understood in terms of their chemical structures and
  biological functions. Polysaccharides cannot be simply sequenced because they are
  often highly branched and lack a uniform structure. Furthermore, large polymeric
  structures cannot be directly analyzed by mass spectrometry techniques, a problem
  that has been solved for polynucleotides and proteins. While restriction enzymes
  have advanced genomic analysis, and trypsin has advanced proteomic analysis, there
  has been no equivalent enzyme for universal polysaccharide digestion. We describe
  the development and application of a chemical method for producing oligosaccharides
  from polysaccharides. The released oligosaccharides are characterized by advanced
  liquid chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry (LC\textendash MS) methods with
  high sensitivity, accuracy and throughput. The technique is first used to identify
  polysaccharides by oligosaccharide fingerprinting. Next, the polysaccharide compositions
  of food and feces are determined, further illustrating the utility of technique
  in food and clinical studies.
