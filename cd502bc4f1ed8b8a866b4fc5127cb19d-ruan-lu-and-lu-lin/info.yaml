abstract: 'Eucommia ulmoides seed oil with high health potential is prone to oxidative
  rancidity due to its rich unsaturated fatty acids. In this work, three natural antioxidants
  were selected for exploring the oxidation resistance of the oil compared with the
  common synthetic antioxidant BHT. Antioxidant activity and its dispersion and migration
  as well as oxygen barrier performance were predicted via the bond dissociation enthalpy
  (BDE), mean square displacement (MSD), binding energy (Ebinding) and permeability
  coefficient (S). The predicted comprehensive performance is as follows: myricetin~{$>~$}epicatechin~{$>~$}caffeic
  acid~{$>~$}BHT. Free radical scavenging assay and Rancimat assay confirmed the antioxidant
  activity and protective effect on oil. That is the protective effect of three natural
  antioxidants on Eucommia ulmoides seed oil is better than BHT and myricetin shows
  the optimal comprehensive performance. The induction period of myricetin/lipid system
  increased 164.5\% compared with the control. The experimental results are in good
  consistent with the simulation predictions.'
