abstract: MassBank is the first public repository of mass spectra of small chemical
  compounds for life sciences ({$<$}3000 Da). The database contains 605 electron-ionization
  mass spectrometry (EI-MS), 137 fast atom bombardment MS and 9276 electrospray ionization
  (ESI)-MS(n) data of 2337 authentic compounds of metabolites, 11 545 EI-MS and 834
  other-MS data of 10,286 volatile natural and synthetic compounds, and 3045 ESI-MS(2)
  data of 679 synthetic drugs contributed by 16 research groups (January 2010). ESI-MS(2)
  data were analyzed under nonstandardized, independent experimental conditions. MassBank
  is a distributed database. Each research group provides data from its own MassBank
  data servers distributed on the Internet. MassBank users can access either all of
  the MassBank data or a subset of the data by specifying one or more experimental
  conditions. In a spectral search to retrieve mass spectra similar to a query mass
  spectrum, the similarity score is calculated by a weighted cosine correlation in
  which weighting exponents on peak intensity and the mass-to-charge ratio are optimized
  to the ESI-MS(2) data. MassBank also provides a merged spectrum for each compound
  prepared by merging the analyzed ESI-MS(2) data on an identical compound under different
  collision-induced dissociation conditions. Data merging has significantly improved
  the precision of the identification of a chemical compound by 21-23\% at a similarity
  score of 0.6. Thus, MassBank is useful for the identification of chemical compounds
  and the publication of experimental data.
