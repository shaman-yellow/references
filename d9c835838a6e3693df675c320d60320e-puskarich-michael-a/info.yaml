abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Sepsis-induced metabolic disturbances include hyperlactatemia,
  disruption of glycolysis, protein catabolism, and altered fatty acid metabolism.
  It may also lower serum L-carnitine that supports the use of L-carnitine supplementation
  as a treatment to ameliorate several of these metabolic consequences. METHODS: To
  further understand the association between L-carnitine-induced changes in serum
  acylcarnitines, fatty acid metabolism and survival, serum samples from (T0), 12{$\mkern1mu$}hfollowing
  completion (T24) of L-carnitine (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}16) or placebo (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}15)
  administration, and 48{$\mkern1mu$}h (T48) after enrollment from patients with septic
  shock enrolled in a randomized control trial were assayed for acylcarnitines, free
  fatty acids, and insulin. Data were analyzed comparing 1-year survivors and nonsurvivors
  within treatment groups. RESULTS: Mortality was 8 of 16 (50\%) and 12 of 15 (80\%)
  at 1 year for L-carnitine and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Free carnitine,
  C2, C3, and C8 acylcarnitines were higher among nonsurvivors at enrollment. L-Carnitine
  treatment increased levels of all measured acylcarnitines; an effect that was sustained
  for at least 36{$\mkern1mu$}h following completion of the infusion and was more
  prominent among nonsurvivors. Several fatty acids followed a similar, though less
  consistent pattern. Glucose, lactate, and insulin levels did not differ based on
  survival or treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: In human patients with septic shock, L-Carnitine
  supplementation increases a broad range of acylcarnitine concentrations that persist
  after cessation of infusion, demonstrating both immediate and sustained effects
  on the serum metabolome. Nonsurvivors demonstrate a distinct metabolic response
  to L-carnitine compared with survivors, which may indicate preexisting or more profound
  metabolic derangement that constrains any beneficial response to treatment.'
