abstract: Within the natural products field there is an increasing emphasis on the
  study of compounds from microbial sources. This has been fuelled by interest in
  the  central role that microorganisms play in mediating both interspecies interactions  and
  host-microbe relationships. To support the study of natural products  chemistry
  produced by microorganisms we released the Natural Products Atlas, a  database of
  known microbial natural products structures, in 2019. This paper  reports the release
  of a new version of the database which includes a full  RESTful application programming
  interface (API), a new website framework, and an  expanded database that includes
  8128 new compounds, bringing the total to 32 552.  In addition to these structural
  and content changes we have added full taxonomic  descriptions for all microbial
  taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from  both NP Classifier and ClassyFire.
  We have also performed manual curation to  review all entries with incomplete configurational
  assignments and have  integrated data from external resources, including CyanoMetDB.
  Finally, we have  improved the user experience by updating the Overview dashboard
  and creating a  dashboard for taxonomic origin. The database can be accessed via
  the new  interactive website at https://www.npatlas.org.
