abstract: We explored potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms regarding multiple
  benefits after bariatric surgery. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for subcutaneous
  adipose tissue (AT) after bariatric surgery were identified by analyzing two expression
  profiles from the GEO. Subsequently, enrichment analysis, GSEA, PPI network, and
  gene-microRNAs and gene-TFs networks were interrogated to identify hub genes and
  associated pathways. Co-expressed DEGs included one that was up-regulated and 22
  that were down-regulated genes. The enrichment analyses indicated that down-regulated
  DEGs were significantly involved in inflammatory responses. GSEA provided comprehensive
  evidence that most genes enriched in pro-inflammation pathways, while gene-sets
  after surgery enriched in metabolism. We identified nine hub genes in the PPI network,
  most of which were validated as highly expressed and hypomethylated in obesity by
  Attie Lab Diabetes and DiseaseMeth databases, respectively. DGIdb was also applied
  to predict potential therapeutic agents that might reverse abnormally high hub gene
  expression. Bariatric surgery induces a significant shift from an obese pro-inflammatory
  state to an anti-inflammatory state, with improvement in adipocyte metabolic function
  - representing key mechanisms whereby AT function improves after bariatric surgery.
  Our study deepens a mechanistic understanding of the benefits of bariatric surgery
  and provides potential biomarkers or treatment targets for further research.
