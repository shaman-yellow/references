abstract: Abstract             Advances in genome sequencing have produced hundreds
  of thousands of bacterial genome sequences, many of which have integrated prophages
  derived from temperate bacteriophages. These prophages play key roles by influencing
  bacterial metabolism, pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, and defense against
  viral attack. However, they vary considerably even among related bacterial strains,
  and they are challenging to identify computationally and to extract precisely for
  comparative genomic analyses. Here, we describe DEPhT, a multimodal tool for prophage
  discovery and extraction. It has three run modes that facilitate rapid screening
  of large numbers of bacterial genomes, precise extraction of prophage sequences,
  and prophage annotation. DEPhT uses genomic architectural features that discriminate
  between phage and bacterial sequences for efficient prophage discovery, and targeted
  homology searches for precise prophage extraction. DEPhT is designed for prophage
  discovery in Mycobacterium genomes but can be adapted broadly to other bacteria.
  We deploy DEPhT to demonstrate that prophages are prevalent in Mycobacterium strains
  but are absent not only from the few well-characterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  strains, but also are absent from all {$\sim$}30 000 sequenced M. tuberculosis strains.
