abstract: We introduce a novel Bayesian probabilistic peak detection algorithm for
  liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). The final probabilistic result
  allows the user to make a final decision about which points in a chromatogram are
  affected by a chromatographic peak and which ones are only affected by noise. The
  use of probabilities contrasts with the traditional method in which a binary answer
  is given, relying on a threshold. By contrast, with the Bayesian peak detection
  presented here, the values of probability can be further propagated into other preprocessing
  steps, which will increase (or decrease) the importance of chromatographic regions
  into the final results. The present work is based on the use of the statistical
  overlap theory of component overlap from Davis and Giddings (Davis, J. M.; Giddings,
  J. Anal. Chem. 1983, 55, 418-424) as prior probability in the Bayesian formulation.
  The algorithm was tested on LC-MS Orbitrap data and was able to successfully distinguish
  chemical noise from actual peaks without any data preprocessing.
