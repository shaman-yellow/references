abstract: COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are increased via unknown mechanisms in
  patients with diabetes and kidney disease. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into host cells. Because ACE2 is a susceptibility factor
  for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter
  ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. Single cell RNA profiling of kidney biopsies
  from healthy living donors and patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2
  expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell-specific localization
  was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by
  exposures to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney
  disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets
  identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular
  epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney)
  that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization,
  and RNA processing. The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial
  cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.
  Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial
  cells obtained from urine samples of 13 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting
  a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program
  that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes. Thus SARS-CoV-2 receptor
  networks can seed further research into risk stratification and therapeutic strategies
  for COVID-19-related kidney damage.
