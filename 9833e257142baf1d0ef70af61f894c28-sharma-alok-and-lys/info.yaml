abstract: Artificial intelligence methods offer exciting new capabilities for the
  discovery of biological mechanisms from raw data because they are able to detect
  vastly more complex patterns of association that cannot be captured by classical
  statistical tests. Among these methods, deep neural networks are currently among
  the most advanced approaches and, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
  have been shown to perform excellently for a variety of difficult tasks. Despite
  that applications of this type of networks to high-dimensional omics data and, most
  importantly, meaningful interpretation of the results returned from such models
  in a biomedical context remains an open problem. Here we present, an approach applying
  a CNN to nonimage data for feature selection. Our pipeline, DeepFeature, can both
  successfully transform omics data into a form that is optimal for fitting a CNN
  model and can also return sets of the most important genes used internally for computing
  predictions. Within the framework, the Snowfall compression algorithm is introduced
  to enable more elements in the fixed pixel framework, and region accumulation and
  element decoder is developed to find elements or genes from the class activation
  maps. In comparative tests for cancer type prediction task, DeepFeature simultaneously
  achieved superior predictive performance and better ability to discover key pathways
  and biological processes meaningful for this context. Capabilities offered by the
  proposed framework can enable the effective use of powerful deep learning methods
  to facilitate the discovery of causal mechanisms in high-dimensional biomedical
  data.
