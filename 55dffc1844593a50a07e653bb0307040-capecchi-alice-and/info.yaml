abstract: Abstract                            Background               Molecular fingerprints
  are essential cheminformatics tools for virtual screening and mapping chemical space.
  Among the different types of fingerprints, substructure fingerprints perform best
  for small molecules such as drugs, while atom-pair fingerprints are preferable for
  large molecules such as peptides. However, no available fingerprint achieves good
  performance on both classes of molecules.                                         Results                                Here
  we set out to design a new fingerprint suitable for both small and large molecules
  by combining substructure and atom-pair concepts. Our quest resulted in a new fingerprint
  called MinHashed atom-pair fingerprint up to a diameter of four bonds (MAP4). In
  this fingerprint the circular substructures with radii of                 r                 \,=\,1
  and                 r\,                 =\,2 bonds around each atom in an atom-pair
  are written as two pairs of SMILES, each pair being combined with the topological
  distance separating the two central atoms. These so-called atom-pair molecular shingles
  are hashed, and the resulting set of hashes is MinHashed to form the MAP4 fingerprint.
  MAP4 significantly outperforms all other fingerprints on an extended benchmark that
  combines the Riniker and Landrum small molecule benchmark with a peptide benchmark
  recovering BLAST analogs from either scrambled or point mutation analogs. MAP4 furthermore
  produces well-organized chemical space tree-maps (TMAPs) for databases as diverse
  as DrugBank, ChEMBL, SwissProt and the Human Metabolome Database (HMBD), and differentiates
  between all metabolites in HMBD, over 70\% of which are indistinguishable from their
  nearest neighbor using substructure fingerprints.                                                        Conclusion                                MAP4
  is a new molecular fingerprint suitable for drugs, biomolecules, and the metabolome
  and can be adopted as a universal fingerprint to describe and search chemical space.
