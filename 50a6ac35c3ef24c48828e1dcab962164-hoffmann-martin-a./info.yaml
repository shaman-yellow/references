abstract: Abstract                        Untargeted metabolomics experiments rely
  on spectral libraries for structure annotation, but these libraries are vastly incomplete;             in
  silico             methods search in structure databases but cannot distinguish
  between correct and incorrect annotations. As biological interpretation relies on
  accurate structure annotations, the ability to assign confidence to such annotations
  is a key outstanding problem. We introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines structure
  database generation,             in silico             annotation, and a confidence
  score consisting of kernel density p-value estimation and a Support Vector Machine
  with enforced directionality of features. In evaluation, COSMIC annotates a substantial
  number of hits at small false discovery rates, and outperforms spectral library
  search for this purpose. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never
  reported before, we annotated twelve novel bile acid conjugates; nine structures
  were confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards.
  Second, we annotated and manually evaluated 315 molecular structures in human samples
  currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Third, we applied COSMIC to
  17,400 experimental runs and annotated 1,715 structures with high confidence that
  were absent from spectral libraries.
