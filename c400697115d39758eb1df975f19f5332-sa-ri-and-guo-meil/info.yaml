abstract: Abnormally high expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been implicated
  in dedifferentiation of radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer (RR-PTC).
  This study aimed to evaluate the differentiation effect of AhR antagonist in PTC,
  and to explore the potential mechanism of it. Results showed that AhR antagonists
  promoted differentiation of PTC, as shown as increase in 125I uptake and Na/I symporter
  (NIS) expression level. CircRNA microarray in K1 cells treated with StemRegenin
  1(SR1) revealed that hsa\_circ\_0006741 (circSH2B3) was down-regulated in SR1 treated
  K1 cells. Downregulation of circSH2B3 increased 125I uptake and NIS expression levels.
  CircSH2B3 acted as an endogenous sponge of hsa-miR-4640-5p and modulated IGF2BP2
  expression. IGF2BP2 overexpression induced dedifferentiation of PTC, while silencing
  IGF2BP2 accelerated differentiation of PTC cells. Rescue studies showed that the
  dedifferentiation activity of AhR was modulated by the circSH2B3/miR-4640-5p/IGF2BP2
  axis. Our findings confirmed for the first time that AhR antagonists promote differentiation
  of PTC via inhibiting the circSH2B3/miR-4640-5p/IGF2BP2 axis, offering a novel therapeutic
  approach and a potential marker for differentiation of PTC.
