abstract: 'We present a new update to MetaboAnalyst (version 4.0) for comprehensive
  metabolomic data analysis, interpretation, and integration with other omics data.
  Since the last major update in 2015, MetaboAnalyst has continued to evolve based
  on user feedback and technological advancements in the field. For this year''s update,
  four new key features have been added to MetaboAnalyst 4.0, including: (1) real-time
  R command tracking and display coupled with the release of a companion MetaboAnalystR
  package; (2) a MS Peaks to Pathways module for prediction of pathway activity from
  untargeted mass spectral data using the mummichog algorithm; (3) a Biomarker Meta-analysis
  module for robust biomarker identification through the combination of multiple metabolomic
  datasets and (4) a Network Explorer module for integrative analysis of metabolomics,
  metagenomics, and/or transcriptomics data. The user interface of MetaboAnalyst 4.0
  has been reengineered to provide a more modern look and feel, as well as to give
  more space and flexibility to introduce new functions. The underlying knowledgebases
  (compound libraries, metabolite sets, and metabolic pathways) have also been updated
  based on the latest data from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). A Docker image
  of MetaboAnalyst is also available to facilitate download and local installation
  of MetaboAnalyst. MetaboAnalyst 4.0 is freely available at http://metaboanalyst.ca.'
