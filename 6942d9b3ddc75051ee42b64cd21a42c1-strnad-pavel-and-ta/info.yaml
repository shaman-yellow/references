abstract: Sepsis and septic shock are characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction
  caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The liver has a central role
  during sepsis, and is essential to the regulation of immune defence during systemic
  infections by mechanisms such as bacterial clearance, acute-phase protein or cytokine
  production and metabolic adaptation to inflammation. However, the liver is also
  a target for sepsis-related injury, including hypoxic hepatitis due to ischaemia
  and shock, cholestasis due to altered bile metabolism, hepatocellular injury due
  to drug toxicity or overwhelming inflammation, as well as distinct pathologies such
  as secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients. Hence, hepatic dysfunction
  substantially impairs the prognosis of sepsis and serves as a powerful independent
  predictor of mortality in the intensive care unit. Sepsis is particularly problematic
  in patients with liver cirrhosis (who experience increased bacterial translocation
  from the gut and impaired microbial defence) as it can trigger acute-on-chronic
  liver failure - a syndrome with high short-term mortality. Here, we review the importance
  of the liver as a guardian, modifier and target of sepsis, the factors that contribute
  to sepsis in patients with liver cirrhosis and new therapeutic strategies.
