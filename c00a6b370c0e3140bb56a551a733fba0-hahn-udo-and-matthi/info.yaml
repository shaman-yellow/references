abstract: We introduce JCORE 2.0, the relaunch of a UIMA-based open software repository
  for full-scale natural language processing originating from the Jena University
  Language \& Information Engineering (JULIE) Lab. In an attempt to put the new release
  of JCORE on firm software engineering ground, we uploaded it to GITHUB, a social
  coding platform, with an underlying source code versioning system and various means
  to support collaboration for software development and code modification management.
  In order to automate the builds of complex NLP pipelines and properly represent
  and track dependencies of the underlying JAVA code, we incorporated MAVEN as part
  of our software configuration management efforts. In the meantime, we have deployed
  our artifacts on MAVEN CENTRAL, as well. JCORE 2.0 offers a broad range of text
  analytics functionality (mostly) for English-language scientific abstracts and full-text
  articles, especially from the life sciences domain.
