abstract: Disease progression prediction and therapeutic drug target discovery for
  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are particularly important, as there is still
  no effective strategy for severe COVID-19 patient treatment. Herein, we performed
  multi-platform omics analysis of serial plasma and urine samples collected from
  patients during the course of COVID-19. Integrative analyses of these omics data
  revealed several potential therapeutic targets, such as ANXA1 and CLEC3B. Molecular
  changes in plasma indicated dysregulation of macrophage and suppression of T cell
  functions in severe patients compared to those in non-severe patients. Further,
  we chose 25 important molecular signatures as potential biomarkers for the prediction
  of disease severity. The prediction power was validated using corresponding urine
  samples and plasma samples from new COVID-19 patient cohort, with AUC reached to
  0.904 and 0.988, respectively. In conclusion, our omics data proposed not only potential
  therapeutic targets, but also biomarkers for understanding the pathogenesis of severe
  COVID-19.
