abstract: In the past decade, advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
  (LC-MS) have revolutionized untargeted metabolomics analyses. By mining metabolomes
  more deeply, researchers are now primed to uncover key metabolites and their associations
  with diseases. The employment of untargeted metabolomics has led to new biomarker
  discoveries and a better mechanistic understanding of diseases with applications
  in precision medicine. However, many major pertinent challenges remain. First, compound
  identification has been poor, and left an overwhelming number of unidentified peaks.
  Second, partial, incomplete metabolomes persist due to factors such as limitations
  in mass spectrometry data acquisition speeds, wide-range of metabolites concentrations,
  and cellular/tissue/temporal-specific expression changes that confound our understanding
  of metabolite perturbations. Third, to contextualize metabolites in pathways and
  biology is difficult because many metabolites partake in multiple pathways, have
  yet to be described species specificity, or possess unannotated or more-complex
  functions that are not easily characterized through metabolomics analyses. From
  a translational perspective, information related to novel metabolite biomarkers,
  metabolic pathways, and drug targets might be sparser than they should be. Thankfully,
  significant progress has been made and novel solutions are emerging, achieved through
  sustained academic and industrial community efforts in terms of hardware, computational,
  and experimental approaches. Given the rapidly growing utility of metabolomics,
  this review will offer new perspectives, increase awareness of the major challenges
  in LC-MS metabolomics that will significantly benefit the metabolomics community
  and also the broader the biomedical community metabolomics aspire to serve.
