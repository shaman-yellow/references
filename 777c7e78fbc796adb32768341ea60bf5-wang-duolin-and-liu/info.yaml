abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>MusiteDeep is\
  \ an online resource providing a deep-learning framework for protein post-translational\
  \ modification (PTM) site prediction and visualization. The predictor only uses\
  \ protein sequences as input and no complex features are needed, which results in\
  \ a real-time prediction for a large number of proteins. It takes less than three\
  \ minutes to predict for 1000 sequences per PTM type. The output is presented at\
  \ the amino acid level for the user-selected PTM types. The framework has been benchmarked\
  \ and has demonstrated competitive performance in PTM site predictions by other\
  \ researchers. In this webserver, we updated the previous framework by utilizing\
  \ more advanced ensemble techniques, and providing prediction and visualization\
  \ for multiple PTMs simultaneously for users to analyze potential PTM cross-talks\
  \ directly. Besides prediction, users can interactively review the predicted PTM\
  \ sites in the context of known PTM annotations and protein 3D structures through\
  \ homology-based search. In addition, the server maintains a local database providing\
  \ pre-processed PTM annotations from Uniport/Swiss-Prot for users to download. This\
  \ database will be updated every three months. The MusiteDeep server is available\
  \ at https://www.musite.net. The stand-alone tools for locally using MusiteDeep\
  \ are available at https://github.com/duolinwang/MusiteDeep_web.</jats:p>"
