abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large and diverse class
  of chemicals of great interest due to their wide commercial applicability, as well  as
  increasing public concern regarding their adverse impacts. A common  terminology
  for PFASs was recommended in 2011, including broad categorization and  detailed
  naming for many PFASs with rather simple molecular structures. Recent  advancements
  in chemical analysis have enabled identification of a wide variety  of PFASs that
  are not covered by this common terminology. The resulting  inconsistency in categorizing
  and naming of PFASs is preventing efficient  assimilation of reported information.
  This article explores how a combination of  expert knowledge and cheminformatics
  approaches could help address this challenge  in a systematic manner. First, the
  "splitPFAS" approach was developed to  systematically subdivide PFASs (for eventual
  categorization) following a  C(n)F(2n+1)-X-R pattern into their various parts, with
  a particular focus on 4  PFAS categories where X is CO, SO(2), CH(2) and CH(2)CH(2).
  Then, the open,  ontology-based "ClassyFire" approach was tested for potential applicability
  to  categorizing and naming PFASs using five scenarios of original and simplified  structures
  based on the "splitPFAS" output. This workflow was applied to a set of  770 PFASs
  from the latest OECD PFAS list. While splitPFAS categorized PFASs as  intended,
  the ClassyFire results were mixed. These results reveal that open  cheminformatics
  approaches have the potential to assist in categorizing PFASs in  a consistent manner,
  while much development is needed for future systematic  naming of PFASs. The "splitPFAS"
  tool and related code are publicly available,  and include options to extend this
  proof-of-concept to encompass further PFASs in  the future.
