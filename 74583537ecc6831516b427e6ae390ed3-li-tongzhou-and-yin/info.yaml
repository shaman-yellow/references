abstract: Abstract             Aberrant sterol lipid metabolism is associated with
  physiological dysfunctions in the aging brain and aging-dependent disorders such
  as neurodegenerative diseases. There is an unmet demand to comprehensively profile
  sterol lipids spatially and temporally in different brain regions during aging.
  Here, we develop an ion mobility-mass spectrometry based four-dimensional sterolomics
  technology leveraged by a machine learning-empowered high-coverage library ({$>$}2000
  sterol lipids) for accurate identification. We apply this four-dimensional technology
  to profile the spatially resolved landscapes of sterol lipids in ten functional
  regions of the mouse brain, and quantitatively uncover \textasciitilde 200 sterol
  lipids uniquely distributed in specific regions with concentrations spanning up
  to 8 orders of magnitude. Further spatial analysis pinpoints age-associated differences
  in region-specific sterol lipid metabolism, revealing changes in the numbers of
  altered sterol lipids, concentration variations, and age-dependent coregulation
  networks. These findings will contribute to our understanding of abnormal sterol
  lipid metabolism and its role in brain diseases.
