abstract: Lysophosphatidylcholines are a group of bioactive lipids heavily investigated
  in the context of inflammation and atherosclerosis development. While present in
  plasma during physiological conditions, their concentration can drastically increase
  in certain inflammatory states. Lysophosphatidylcholines are widely regarded as
  potent pro-inflammatory and deleterious mediators, but an increasing number of more
  recent studies show multiple beneficial properties under various pathological conditions.
  Many of the discrepancies in the published studies are due to the investigation
  of different species or mixtures of lysophatidylcholines and the use of supra-physiological
  concentrations in the absence of serum or other carrier proteins. Furthermore, interpretation
  of the results is complicated by the rapid metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC) in cells and tissues to pro-inflammatory lysophosphatidic acid. Interestingly,
  most of the recent studies, in contrast to older studies, found lower LPC plasma
  levels associated with unfavorable disease outcomes. Being the most abundant lysophospholipid
  in plasma, it is of utmost importance to understand its physiological functions
  and shed light on the discordant literature connected to its research. LPCs should
  be recognized as important homeostatic mediators involved in all stages of vascular
  inflammation. In this review, we want to point out potential pro- and anti-inflammatory
  activities of lysophospholipids in the vascular system and highlight recent discoveries
  about the effect of lysophosphatidylcholines on immune cells at the endothelial
  vascular interface. We will also look at their potential clinical application as
  biomarkers.
