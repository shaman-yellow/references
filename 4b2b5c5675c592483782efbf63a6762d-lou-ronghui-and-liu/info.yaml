abstract: Abstract             Phosphoproteomics integrating data-independent acquisition
  (DIA) enables deep phosphoproteome profiling with improved quantification reproducibility
  and accuracy compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA)-based phosphoproteomics.
  DIA data mining heavily relies on a spectral library that in most cases is built
  on DDA analysis of the same sample. Construction of this project-specific DDA library
  impairs the analytical throughput, limits the proteome coverage, and increases the
  sample size for DIA phosphoproteomics. Herein we introduce a deep neural network,
  DeepPhospho, which conceptually differs from previous deep learning models to achieve
  accurate predictions of LC-MS/MS data for phosphopeptides. By leveraging in silico
  libraries generated by DeepPhospho, we establish a DIA workflow for phosphoproteome
  profiling which involves DIA data acquisition and data mining with DeepPhospho predicted
  libraries, thus circumventing the need of DDA library construction. Our DeepPhospho-empowered
  workflow substantially expands the phosphoproteome coverage while maintaining high
  quantification performance, which leads to the discovery of more signaling pathways
  and regulated kinases in an EGF signaling study than the DDA library-based approach.
  DeepPhospho is provided as a web server as well as an offline app to facilitate
  user access to model training, predictions and library generation.
