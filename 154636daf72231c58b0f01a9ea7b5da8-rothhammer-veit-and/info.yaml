abstract: Astrocytes have important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) during
  health and disease. Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response
  to type I interferons (IFN-Is) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity
  and also in CNS lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN-I signaling
  in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
  (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AHR) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory
  effects of nasally administered interferon (IFN)-{$\beta$} are partly mediated by
  AHR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AHR agonists that
  have an effect on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased
  following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was
  reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites
  indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate, indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde, or the
  bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of
  AHR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-Is produced in the
  CNS function in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by
  the gut flora to activate AHR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.
