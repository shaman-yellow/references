abstract: Serum lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is described to decline in patients
  with chronic liver diseases. Here it was evaluated which of the LPC species are
  associated with liver function. LPC species were quantified by direct flow-injection
  electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in serum of 45 patients with mainly
  alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC is 52.1 (31.7-110.0) {$\mu$}mol/l in serum
  of patients with CHILD-PUGH score C (decompensated liver cirrhosis) and significantly
  lower compared to patients with well-compensated disease (CHILD-PUGH score A) with
  114.1 (12.3-401.4) {$\mu$}mol/l. Mono- and polyunsaturated LPC are not changed in
  these groups. Saturated LPC is negatively correlated with the model for end-stage
  liver disease score, bilirubin and galectin-3 and positively with Quick prothrombin
  time. Ascites and varices are complications of liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC does,
  however, not correlate with hepatic venous pressure gradient, ascites volume and
  variceal size. Unexpectedly, saturated LPC measured in serum of 42 patients declines
  from 88.4 (27.8-177.5) {$\mu$}mol/l to 72.4 (27.6-141.8) {$\mu$}mol/l shortly after
  transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt implantation. Hepatic vein saturated
  LPC (82.3 (12.4-161.7) {$\mu$}mol/l) is higher than portal vein levels (78.8 (10.1-161.0)
  {$\mu$}mol/l) suggesting hepatic release of this lipid species. Current data demonstrate
  that systemic saturated LPC species are reduced in patients with decompensated liver
  cirrhosis and associated with mortality risk.
