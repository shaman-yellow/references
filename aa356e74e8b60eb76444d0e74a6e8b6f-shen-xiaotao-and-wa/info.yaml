abstract: Large-scale metabolite annotation is a challenge in liquid chromatogram-mass
  spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics. Here, we develop a metabolic
  reaction network (MRN)-based recursive algorithm (MetDNA) that expands metabolite
  annotations without the need for a comprehensive standard spectral library. MetDNA
  is based on the rationale that seed metabolites and their reaction-paired neighbors
  tend to share structural similarities resulting in similar MS2 spectra. MetDNA characterizes
  initial seed metabolites using a small library of MS2 spectra, and utilizes their
  experimental MS2 spectra as surrogate spectra to annotate their reaction-paired
  neighbor metabolites, which subsequently serve as the basis for recursive analysis.
  Using different LC-MS platforms, data acquisition methods, and biological samples,
  we showcase the utility and versatility of MetDNA and demonstrate that about 2000
  metabolites can cumulatively be annotated from one experiment. Our results demonstrate
  that MetDNA substantially expands metabolite annotation, enabling quantitative assessment
  of metabolic pathways and facilitating integrative multi-omics analysis.
