abstract: Metabolomics is an emerging 'omics' science involving the comprehensive
  characterization of metabolites and metabolism in biological systems. Recent advances
  in metabolomics technologies are leading to a growing number of mainstream biomedical
  applications. In particular, metabolomics is increasingly being used to diagnose
  disease, understand disease mechanisms, identify novel drug targets, customize drug
  treatments and monitor therapeutic outcomes. This Review discusses some of the latest
  technological advances in metabolomics, focusing on the application of metabolomics
  towards uncovering the underlying causes of complex diseases (such as atherosclerosis,
  cancer and diabetes), the growing role of metabolomics in drug discovery and its
  potential effect on precision medicine.
