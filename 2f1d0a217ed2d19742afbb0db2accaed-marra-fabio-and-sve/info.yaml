abstract: The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, particularly the
  mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype characterised
  by hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and fibrosis is still incompletely understood.
  Herein, we discuss two pivotal aspects of the pathogenesis of NASH. We first analyse
  the initial mechanisms responsible for hepatocellular damage and inflammation, which
  derive from the toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that
  the total amount of triglycerides stored in hepatocytes is not the major determinant
  of lipotoxicity, and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents on liver
  cells. In particular, the role of free fatty acids such as palmitic acid, cholesterol,
  lysophosphatidylcholine and ceramides has recently emerged. These lipotoxic agents
  affect the cell behaviour via multiple mechanisms, including activation of signalling
  cascades and death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial
  function, and oxidative stress. In the second part of this review, the cellular
  and molecular players involved in the cross-talk between the gut and the liver are
  considered. These include modifications to the microbiota, which provide signals
  through the intestine and bacterial products, as well as hormones produced in the
  bowel that affect metabolism at different levels including the liver. Finally, the
  activation of nuclear receptors by bile acids is analysed.
