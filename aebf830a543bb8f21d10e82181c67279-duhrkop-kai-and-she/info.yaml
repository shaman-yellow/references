abstract: Metabolites provide a direct functional signature of cellular state. Untargeted
  metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem MS to identify the thousands of
  compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain
  unknown. We present a method for searching molecular structure databases using tandem
  MS data of small molecules. Our method computes a fragmentation tree that best explains
  the fragmentation spectrum of an unknown molecule. We use the fragmentation tree
  to predict the molecular structure fingerprint of the unknown compound using machine
  learning. This fingerprint is then used to search a molecular structure database
  such as PubChem. Our method is shown to improve on the competing methods for computational
  metabolite identification by a considerable margin.
