abstract: The edible and medicinal part of Inula nervosa Wall. (Xiaoheiyao) is confined
  to its root without sufficient phytochemical and biological investigation. In this  study,
  the secondary metabolites of root, stem, leaf, and flower of I. nervosa  Wall. were
  visualized using Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking  (GNPS), MolNetEnhancer,
  XCMS(xcmsonline.scripps.edu) analysis, and `ili mapping  based on high performance
  liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  (HPLC-MS/MS) data to reveal their
  chemical differences. Among the 11 kinds of  chemical repertoires annotated by MolNetEnhancer
  and 16 hits against the GNPS  library, 10-isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymol isobutyrate
  (1) was revealed as the  most dominant and responsible marker between the roots
  and the other parts.  Moreover, a battery of unique MS features as well as differential
  markers were  discovered from different parts of the plant. The chemical differences
  contribute  to the bioactivity differences, which presented in the  2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl
  (DPPH)assay and H(2)O(2)-insulted HepG2 cells and  were in significant correlations
  with the contents of 1. real-time reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction
  (RT-PCR)results demonstrated that I.  nervosa Wall. extracts upregulated the mRNA
  expression of nuclear factor  E2-related factor 2(Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1(HO-1),
  NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase  1 (NQO1), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD),
  and glutamate-cysteine ligase  catalytic subunit (GCLC) actors involved in antioxidative
  response in  H(2)O(2)-challenged HepG2 cells. These findings support the roots of
  I. nervosa  Wall. as active parts of Xiaoheiyao, and also indicate the potential
  antioxidant  activities of other parts.
