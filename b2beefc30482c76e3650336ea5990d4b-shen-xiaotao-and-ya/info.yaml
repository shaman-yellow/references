abstract: Abstract                            Reproducibility, traceability, and transparency
  have been long-standing issues for metabolomics data analysis. Multiple tools have
  been developed, but limitations still exist. Here, we present the tidyMass project
  (               https://www.tidymass.org/               ), a comprehensive R-based
  computational framework that can achieve the traceable, shareable, and reproducible
  workflow needs of data processing and analysis for LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics.
  TidyMass is an ecosystem of R packages that share an underlying design philosophy,
  grammar, and data structure, which provides a comprehensive, reproducible, and object-oriented
  computational framework. The modular architecture makes tidyMass a highly flexible
  and extensible tool, which other users can improve and integrate with other tools
  to customize their own pipeline.
