abstract: We present an integrated analysis of the clinical measurements, immune cells,
  and plasma multi-omics of 139 COVID-19 patients representing all levels of disease
  severity, from serial blood draws collected during the first week of infection following
  diagnosis. We identify a major shift between mild and moderate disease, at which
  point elevated inflammatory signaling is accompanied by the loss of specific classes
  of metabolites and metabolic processes. Within this stressed plasma environment
  at moderate disease, multiple unusual immune cell phenotypes emerge and amplify
  with increasing disease severity. We condensed over 120,000 immune features into
  a single axis to capture how different immune cell classes coordinate in response
  to SARS-CoV-2. This immune-response axis independently aligns with the major plasma
  composition changes, with clinical metrics of blood clotting, and with the sharp
  transition between mild and moderate disease. This study suggests that moderate
  disease may provide the most effective setting for therapeutic intervention.
