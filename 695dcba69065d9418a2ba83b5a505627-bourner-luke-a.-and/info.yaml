abstract: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is a transcription
  factor present in immune cells as a long and short isoform, referred to as isoforms
  1 and 3, respectively. However, investigation into potential ARNT isoform\textendash
  specific immune functions is lacking despite the well-established heterodimerization
  requirement of ARNT with, and for the activity of, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor
  (AhR), a critical mediator of immune homeostasis. Here, using global and targeted
  transcriptomics analyses, we show that the relative ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio in human
  T cell lymphoma cells dictates the amplitude and direction of AhR target gene regulation.
  Specifically, shifting the ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio lower by suppressing isoform 1
  enhances, or higher by suppressing isoform 3 abrogates, AhR responsiveness to ligand
  activation through preprograming a cellular genetic background that directs explicit
  gene expression patterns. Moreover, the fluctuations in gene expression patterns
  that accompany a decrease or increase in the ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio are associated
  with inflammation or immunosuppression, respectively. Molecular studies identified
  the unique casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site within isoform 1 as an essential
  parameter to the mechanism of ARNT isoform\textendash specific regulation of AhR
  signaling. Notably, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ARNT isoform 1 is dependent
  on ligand-induced AhR nuclear translocation and is required for optimal AhR target
  gene regulation. These observations reveal ARNT as a central modulator of AhR activity
  predicated on the status of the ARNT isoform ratio and suggest that ARNT-based therapies
  are a viable option for tuning the immune system to target immune disorders.
