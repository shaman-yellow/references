abstract: Bile acids are the end products of cholesterol catabolism. Hepatic bile
  acid synthesis accounts for a major fraction of daily cholesterol turnover in humans.
  Biliary secretion of bile acids generates bile flow and facilitates hepatobiliary
  secretion of lipids, lipophilic metabolites, and xenobiotics. In the intestine,
  bile acids are essential for the absorption, transport, and metabolism of dietary
  fats and lipid-soluble vitamins. Extensive research in the last 2 decades has unveiled
  new functions of bile acids as signaling molecules and metabolic integrators. The
  bile acid-activated nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor,
  constitutive androstane receptor, vitamin D receptor, and G protein-coupled bile
  acid receptor play critical roles in the regulation of lipid, glucose, and energy
  metabolism, inflammation, and drug metabolism and detoxification. Bile acid synthesis
  exhibits a strong diurnal rhythm, which is entrained by fasting and refeeding as
  well as nutrient status and plays an important role for maintaining metabolic homeostasis.
  Recent research revealed an interaction of liver bile acids and gut microbiota in
  the regulation of liver metabolism. Circadian disturbance and altered gut microbiota
  contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, nonalcoholic
  fatty liver disease, diabetes, and obesity. Bile acids and their derivatives are
  potential therapeutic agents for treating metabolic diseases of the liver.
