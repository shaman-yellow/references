abstract: Meniscus plays an important role in joint homeostasis. Tear or degeneration
  of meniscus might facilitate the process of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Hence, to
  investigate the transcriptome change during meniscus degeneration, we reveal the
  alterations of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA),
  and circular RNA (circRNA) in meniscus during OA by whole-transcriptome sequence.
  A total of 375 mRNAs, 15 miRNAs, 56 lncRNAs, and 90 circRNAs were significantly
  altered in the degenerative meniscus treated with interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}).
  More importantly, highly specific co-expression RNA (ceRNA) networks regulated by
  lncRNA LOC107986251-miR-212-5p-SESN3 and hsa\_circ\_0018069-miR-147b-3p-TJP2 were
  screened out during IL-induced meniscus degeneration, unveiling potential therapeutic
  targets for meniscus degeneration during the OA process. Furthermore, lipocalin-2
  (LCN2) and RAB27B were identified as potential biomarkers in meniscus degeneration
  by overlapping three previously constructed databases of OA menisci. LCN2 and RAB27B
  were both upregulated in osteoarthritic menisci and IL-1{$\beta$}-treated menisci
  and were highly associated with the severity of OA. This could introduce potential
  novel molecules into the database of clinical diagnostic biomarkers and possible
  therapeutic targets for early-stage OA treatment.
