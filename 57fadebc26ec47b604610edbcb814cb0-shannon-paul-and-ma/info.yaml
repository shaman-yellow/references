abstract: Cytoscape is an open source software project for integrating biomolecular
  interaction networks with high-throughput expression data and other molecular states
  into a unified conceptual framework. Although applicable to any system of molecular
  components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction
  with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that
  are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software
  Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate
  the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and
  to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible
  through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional
  computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins
  are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes
  in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to
  DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for               Halobacterium               ,
  and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.
