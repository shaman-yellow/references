abstract: Metabolomics generates a profile of small molecules that are derived from
  cellular metabolism and can directly reflect the outcome of complex networks of
  biochemical reactions, thus providing insights into multiple aspects of cellular
  physiology. Technological advances have enabled rapid and increasingly expansive
  data acquisition with samples as small as single cells; however, substantial challenges
  in the field remain. In this primer we provide an overview of metabolomics, especially
  mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics, which uses liquid chromatography (LC)
  for separation, and discuss its utilities and limitations. We identify and discuss
  several areas at the frontier of metabolomics. Our goal is to give the reader a
  sense of what might be accomplished when conducting a metabolomics experiment, now
  and in the near future.
