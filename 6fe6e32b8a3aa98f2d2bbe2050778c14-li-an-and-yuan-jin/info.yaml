abstract: Study of the effects and protective mechanism of               Eucommia
  ulmoides               extract on renal injury caused by long-term high purine diets
  in rats.                        ,                             Diets of overloaded
  purine-rich foods for a long time are one of the important reasons to cause renal
  lesions.               Eucommia ulmoides               is one of the traditional
  Chinese medicine herbs, which has been used to recover functions of the kidney.
  However, its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the
  effects and protective mechanism of               Eucommia ulmoides               extract
  on renal injury caused by long-term high purine diets in rats. SD rats underwent
  an intragastric adenine (200 mg kg               -1               d               -1               )
  administration for 9 weeks and were treated for 15 weeks. The results demonstrated
  that               Eucommia ulmoides               extract significantly reduced
  serum Cre and BUN levels in rats. H\&E and Masson's trichrome stains showed notable
  lowering of the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the formation of fibrous tissues
  and collagen fibers, and improvement in the pathological morphology of kidneys.
  It also suppressed the protein and mRNA expressions of TGF-{$\beta$}1 and {$\alpha$}-SMA
  and enhanced E-cadherin expression. Meanwhile,               Eucommia ulmoides               extract
  prominently inhibited the mRNA expression of Col I, Col III, Col IV, TIMP-1, and
  TIMP-2 and promoted expressions of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Through our study, it
  is the first time to prove that               Eucommia ulmoides               extract
  could ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis and may involve in the regulation of
  the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation enzyme (MMPs/TIMPs) system, promotion
  of the expression of E-cadherin, and suppression of expressions of TGF-{$\beta$}1
  and {$\alpha$}-SMA. The results provide a significant implication for the utilization
  of               Eunomia Ulmoides               extract as functional foods to enhance
  renal functions and improve renal injury caused by high purine diets.
