abstract: "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>One of the most\
  \ pressing challenges in genomic medicine is to understand the role played by genetic\
  \ variation in health and disease. Thanks to the exploration of genomic variants\
  \ at large scale, hundreds of thousands of disease-associated loci have been uncovered.\
  \ However, the identification of variants of clinical relevance is a significant\
  \ challenge that requires comprehensive interrogation of previous knowledge and\
  \ linkage to new experimental results. To assist in this complex task, we created\
  \ DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org/), a knowledge management platform integrating\
  \ and standardizing data about disease associated genes and variants from multiple\
  \ sources, including the scientific literature. DisGeNET covers the full spectrum\
  \ of human diseases as well as normal and abnormal traits. The current release covers\
  \ more than 24 000 diseases and traits, 17 000 genes and 117 000 genomic variants.\
  \ The latest developments of DisGeNET include new sources of data, novel data attributes\
  \ and prioritization metrics, a redesigned web interface and recently launched APIs.\
  \ Thanks to the data standardization, the combination of expert curated information\
  \ with data automatically mined from the scientific literature, and a suite of tools\
  \ for accessing its publicly available data, DisGeNET is an interoperable resource\
  \ supporting a variety of applications in genomic medicine and drug R&amp;D.</jats:p>"
