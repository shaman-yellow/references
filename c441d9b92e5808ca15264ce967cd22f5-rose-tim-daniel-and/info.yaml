abstract: Significance             Molecular patient stratification and disease subtyping
  are ongoing and high-impact problems that rely on the identification of characteristic
  molecular signatures. Current computational methods show high sensitivity to custom
  parameterization, which leads to inconsistent performance on different molecular
  data. Our new method, MoSBi (molecular signature identification using biclustering),
  1) enables so far unmatched high performance for stratification and subtyping across
  datasets of various different biomolecules, 2) provides a scalable solution for
  visualizing the results and their correspondence to clinical factors, and 3) has
  immediate practical relevance through its automatic workflow where individual selection,
  parameterization, screening, and visualization of biclustering algorithms is not
  required. MoSBi is a major step forward with a high impact for clinical and wet-lab
  researchers.           ,              The improving access to increasing amounts
  of biomedical data provides completely new chances for advanced patient stratification
  and disease subtyping strategies. This requires computational tools that produce
  uniformly robust results across highly heterogeneous molecular data. Unsupervised
  machine learning methodologies are able to discover de novo patterns in such data.
  Biclustering is especially suited by simultaneously identifying sample groups and
  corresponding feature sets across heterogeneous omics data. The performance of available
  biclustering algorithms heavily depends on individual parameterization and varies
  with their application. Here, we developed MoSBi (molecular signature identification
  using biclustering), an automated multialgorithm ensemble approach that integrates
  results utilizing an error model-supported similarity network. We systematically
  evaluated the performance of 11 available and established biclustering algorithms
  together with MoSBi. For this, we used transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics
  data, as well as synthetic datasets covering various data properties. Profiting
  from multialgorithm integration, MoSBi identified robust group and disease-specific
  signatures across all scenarios, overcoming single algorithm specificities. Furthermore,
  we developed a scalable network-based visualization of bicluster communities that
  supports biological hypothesis generation. MoSBi is available as an R package and
  web service to make automated biclustering analysis accessible for application in
  molecular sample stratification.
