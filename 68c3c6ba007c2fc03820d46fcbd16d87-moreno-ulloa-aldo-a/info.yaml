abstract: Marine microbes are known to degrade hydrocarbons; however, microbes inhabiting
  deep-sea sediments remain largely unexplored. Previous studies into the classical  pathways
  of marine microbial metabolism reveal diverse chemistries; however,  metabolic profiling
  of marine microbes cultured with hydrocarbons is limited. In  this study, taxonomic
  (amplicon sequencing) profiles of two environmental  deep-sea sediments ({$>$}1,200
  m deep) were obtained, along with taxonomic and  metabolomic (mass spectrometry-based
  metabolomics) profiles of microbes harbored  in deep-sea sediments cultured with
  hydrocarbons as the sole energy source.  Samples were collected from the Gulf of
  M\'exico (GM) and cultured for 28\,days  using simple (toluene, benzene, hexadecane,
  and naphthalene) and complex  (petroleum API 40) hydrocarbon mixtures as the sole
  energy sources. The sediment  samples harbored diverse microbial communities predominantly
  classified into  Woeseiaceae and Kiloniellaceae families, whereas Pseudomonadaceae
  and  Enterobacteriaceae families prevailed after sediments were cultured with  hydrocarbons.
  Chemical profiling of microbial metabolomes revealed diverse  chemical groups belonging
  primarily to the lipids and lipid-like molecules  superclass, as well as the organoheterocyclic
  compound superclass (ClassyFire  annotation). Metabolomic data and prediction of
  functional profiles indicated an  increase in aromatic and alkane degradation in
  samples cultured with  hydrocarbons. Previously unreported metabolites, identified
  as intermediates in  the degradation of hydrocarbons, were annotated as hydroxylated
  polyunsaturated  fatty acids and carboxylated benzene derivatives. In summary, this
  study used  mass spectrometry-based metabolomics coupled to chemoinformatics to
  demonstrate  how microbes from deep-sea sediments could be cultured in the presence
  of  hydrocarbons. This study also highlights how this experimental approach can
  be  used to increase the understanding of hydrocarbon degradation by deep-sea  sediment
  microbes.IMPORTANCE High-throughput technologies and emerging  informatics tools
  have significantly advanced knowledge of hydrocarbon metabolism  by marine microbes.
  However, research into microbes inhabiting deep-sea sediments  ({$>$}1,000 m) is
  limited compared to those found in shallow waters. In this study, a  nontargeted
  and nonclassical approach was used to examine the diversity of  bacterial taxa and
  the metabolic profiles of hydrocarbon-degrading deep-sea  microbes. In conclusion,
  this study used metabolomics and chemoinformatics to  demonstrate that microbes
  from deep-sea sediment origin thrive in the presence of  toxic and difficult-to-metabolize
  hydrocarbons. Notably, this study provides  evidence of previously unreported metabolites
  and the global chemical repertoire  associated with the metabolism of hydrocarbons
  by deep-sea microbes.
