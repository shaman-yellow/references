abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In spite of its great promise, metabolomics has proven difficult
  to execute in an untargeted and generalizable manner. Liquid chromatography-mass
  spectrometry (LC-MS) has made it possible to gather data on thousands of cellular
  metabolites. However, matching metabolites to their spectral features continues
  to be a bottleneck, meaning that much of the collected information remains uninterpreted
  and that new metabolites are seldom discovered in untargeted studies. These challenges
  require new approaches that consider compounds beyond those available in curated
  biochemistry databases. DESCRIPTION: Here we present Metabolic In silico Network
  Expansions (MINEs), an extension of known metabolite databases to include molecules
  that have not been observed, but are likely to occur based on known metabolites
  and common biochemical reactions. We utilize an algorithm called the Biochemical
  Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE) and expert-curated reaction rules
  based on the Enzyme Commission classification system to propose the novel chemical
  structures and reactions that comprise MINE databases. Starting from the Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) COMPOUND database, the MINE contains over 571,000 compounds,
  of which 93\% are not present in the PubChem database. However, these MINE compounds
  have on average higher structural similarity to natural products than compounds
  from KEGG or PubChem. MINE databases were able to propose annotations for 98.6\%
  of a set of 667 MassBank spectra, 14\% more than KEGG alone and equivalent to PubChem
  while returning far fewer candidates per spectra than PubChem (46 vs. 1715 median
  candidates). Application of MINEs to LC-MS accurate mass data enabled the identity
  of an unknown peak to be confidently predicted. CONCLUSIONS: MINE databases are
  freely accessible for non-commercial use via user-friendly web-tools at http://minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov
  and developer-friendly APIs. MINEs improve metabolomics peak identification as compared
  to general chemical databases whose results include irrelevant synthetic compounds.
  Furthermore, MINEs complement and expand on previous in silico generated compound
  databases that focus on human metabolism. We are actively developing the database;
  future versions of this resource will incorporate transformation rules for spontaneous
  chemical reactions and more advanced filtering and prioritization of candidate structures.
