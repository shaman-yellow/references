abstract: Abstract             Characterizing the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) bound
  ligandome by mass spectrometry (MS) holds great promise for developing vaccines
  and drugs for immune-oncology. Still, the identification of non-tryptic peptides
  presents substantial computational challenges. To address these, we synthesized
  and analyzed {$>$}300,000 peptides by multi-modal LC-MS/MS within the ProteomeTools
  project representing HLA class I \& II ligands and products of the proteases AspN
  and LysN. The resulting data enabled training of a single model using the deep learning
  framework Prosit, allowing the accurate prediction of fragment ion spectra for tryptic
  and non-tryptic peptides. Applying Prosit demonstrates that the identification of
  HLA peptides can be improved up to 7-fold, that 87\% of the proposed proteasomally
  spliced HLA peptides may be incorrect and that dozens of additional immunogenic
  neo-epitopes can be identified from patient tumors in published data. Together,
  the provided peptides, spectra and computational tools substantially expand the
  analytical depth of immunopeptidomics workflows.
