abstract: Abstract             Molecular networking connects mass spectra of molecules
  based on the similarity of their fragmentation patterns. However, during ionization,
  molecules commonly form multiple ion species with different fragmentation behavior.
  As a result, the fragmentation spectra of these ion species often remain unconnected
  in tandem mass spectrometry-based molecular networks, leading to redundant and disconnected
  sub-networks of the same compound classes. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop
  Ion Identity Molecular Networking (IIMN) that integrates chromatographic peak shape
  correlation analysis into molecular networks to connect and collapse different ion
  species of the same molecule. The new feature relationships improve network connectivity
  for structurally related molecules, can be used to reveal unknown ion-ligand complexes,
  enhance annotation within molecular networks, and facilitate the expansion of spectral
  reference libraries. IIMN is integrated into various open source feature finding
  tools and the GNPS environment. Moreover, IIMN-based spectral libraries with a broad
  coverage of ion species are publicly available.
