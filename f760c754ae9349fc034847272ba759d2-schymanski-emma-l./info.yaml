abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The fourth round of the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule
  Identification (CASMI) Contest ( www.casmi-contest.org ) was held in 2016, with
  two new categories for automated methods. This article covers the 208 challenges
  in Categories 2 and 3, without and with metadata, from organization, participation,
  results and post-contest evaluation of CASMI 2016 through to perspectives for future
  contests and small molecule annotation/identification. RESULTS: The Input Output
  Kernel Regression (CSI:IOKR) machine learning approach performed best in "Category
  2: Best Automatic Structural Identification-In Silico Fragmentation Only", won by
  Team Brouard with 41\% challenge wins. The winner of "Category 3: Best Automatic
  Structural Identification-Full Information" was Team Kind (MS-FINDER), with 76\%
  challenge wins. The best methods were able to achieve over 30\% Top~1 ranks in Category~2,
  with all methods ranking the correct candidate in the Top~10 in around 50\% of challenges.
  This success rate rose to 70\% Top~1 ranks in Category~3, with candidates in the
  Top~10 in over 80\% of the challenges. The machine learning and chemistry-based
  approaches are shown to perform in complementary ways. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement
  in (semi-)automated fragmentation methods for small molecule identification has
  been substantial. The achieved high rates of correct candidates in the Top~1 and
  Top~10, despite large candidate numbers, open up great possibilities for high-throughput
  annotation of untargeted analysis for "known unknowns". As more high quality training
  data becomes available, the improvements in machine learning methods will likely
  continue, but the alternative approaches still provide valuable complementary information.
  Improved integration of experimental context will also improve identification success
  further for "real life" annotations. The true "unknown unknowns" remain to be evaluated
  in future CASMI contests. Graphical abstract .'
