abstract: Empirical Bayes is a statistical approach for estimating a series of unknown
  parameters from a series of associated data observations. It provides an effective
  means to ``borrow strength'' from the ensemble of cases when making inference about
  each individual case. Such methods are ideally suited to genomic applications where
  data is collected for tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. Empirical Bayes
  methods can however be less effective when highly exceptional cases are present.
  This article proposes a practical solution whereby exceptional cases are identified
  and the amount of ``learning'' from the ensemble appropriate for each case is assessed
  on a case-specific basis. The approach is developed in detail for the problem of
  estimating genewise variances from microarray data. In this context, the proposed
  robust empirical Bayes procedure recognizes and protects against hyper-variable
  genes. The new procedure improves statistical power for most genes in many microarray
  data sets. Simulations show that the robust estimation procedure correctly controls
  the type I error rate and does not increase the number of false discoveries when
  no hyper-variable genes are present. In the presence of hyper-variable genes, the
  robust method improves power to detect differential expression for the majority
  of genes that are not outliers. The proposed robust method is applied to an example
  microarray data set, on which it correctly identifies and downweights genes associated
  with a hidden covariate and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant
  to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software
  package which is freely available from the Bioconductor repository.
