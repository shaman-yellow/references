abstract: Metabolomics enables the profiling of large numbers of small molecules in
  cells, tissues and biological fluids. These molecules, which include amino acids,
  carbohydrates, lipids, nucleotides and their metabolites, can be detected quantitatively.
  Metabolomic methods, often focused on the information-rich analytical techniques
  of NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, have potential for early diagnosis, monitoring
  therapy and defining disease pathogenesis in many therapeutic areas, including rheumatic
  diseases. By performing global metabolite profiling, also known as untargeted metabolomics,
  new discoveries linking cellular pathways to biological mechanisms are being revealed
  and are shaping our understanding of cell biology, physiology and medicine. These
  pathways can potentially be targeted to diagnose and treat patients with immune-mediated
  diseases.
