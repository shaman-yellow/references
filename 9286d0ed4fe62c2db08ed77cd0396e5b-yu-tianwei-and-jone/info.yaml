abstract: 'Abstract             Motivation: Peak detection is a key step in the preprocessing
  of untargeted metabolomics data generated from high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass
  spectrometry (LC/MS). The common practice is to use filters with predetermined parameters
  to select peaks in the LC/MS profile. This rigid approach can cause suboptimal performance
  when the choice of peak model and parameters do not suit the data characteristics.             Results:
  Here we present a method that learns directly from various data features of the
  extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) to differentiate between true peak regions from
  noise regions in the LC/MS profile. It utilizes the knowledge of known metabolites,
  as well as robust machine learning approaches. Unlike currently available methods,
  this new approach does not assume a parametric peak shape model and allows maximum
  flexibility. We demonstrate the superiority of the new approach using real data.
  Because matching to known metabolites entails uncertainties and cannot be considered
  a gold standard, we also developed a probabilistic receiver-operating characteristic
  (pROC) approach that can incorporate uncertainties.             Availability and
  implementation: The new peak detection approach is implemented as part of the apLCMS
  package available at http://web1.sph.emory.edu/apLCMS/             Contact: ~tyu8@emory.edu             Supplementary
