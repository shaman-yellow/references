abstract: Optical chemical structure recognition from scientific publications is essential
  for rediscovering a chemical structure. It is an extremely challenging problem,
  and current rule-based and deep-learning methods cannot achieve satisfactory recognition
  rates. Herein, we propose SwinOCSR, an end-to-end model based on a Swin Transformer.
  This model uses the Swin Transformer as the backbone to extract image features and
  introduces Transformer models to convert chemical information from publications
  into DeepSMILES. A novel chemical structure dataset was constructed to train and
  verify our method. Our proposed Swin Transformer-based model was extensively tested
  against the backbone of existing publicly available deep learning methods. The experimental
  results show that our model significantly outperforms the compared methods, demonstrating
  the model's effectiveness. Moreover, we used a focal loss to address the token imbalance
  problem in the text representation of the chemical structure diagram, and our model
  achieved an accuracy of 98.58\%.
