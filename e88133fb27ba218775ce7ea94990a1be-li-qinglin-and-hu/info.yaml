abstract: Cornus officinalis Sieb et. Zucc and Paeonia lactiflora Pall. have exhibited
  favorable therapeutic effects against rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the specific
  mechanisms of their active compounds remain unclear. The aim of this study was to
  comprehensively analyze the therapeutic mechanisms of selected active compounds
  in Cornus officinalis (loganin, ursolic acid, and morroniside) and Paeonia lactiflora
  (paeoniflorin and albiflorin) via network pharmacology. The pharmacological properties
  of the five active compounds were evaluated and their potential target genes were
  identified by database screening. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes functional analysis were performed to determine the enriched molecular
  pathways associated with the active compounds. Using network pharmacology tools,
  eight genes (IL1{$\beta$}, VEGFA, STAT3, TP53, IL6, TNF, FOS, and LGALS3) were identified
  as common targets between RA and the five active compounds. Molecular docking simulation
  revealed the compound-target relationship between the five active compounds and
  three selected targets from the eight common ones (LGALS3, STAT3, and VEGFA). The
  compound-target relationships were subsequently validated via preliminary               in
  vivo               experiments in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis. Rats
  subjected to collagen-induced arthritis showed increased protein expression of LGALS3,
  STAT3, and VEGFA in synovial tissues. However, treatment using Cornus officinalis
  or/and Paeonia lactiflora, as well as their most drug-like active compounds (ursolic
  acid or/and paeoniflorin, respectively, identified based on pharmacological properties),
  attenuated the expression of these three targets, as previously predicted. Collectively,
  network pharmacology allowed the pharmacological and molecular roles of Cornus officinalis
  and Paeonia lactiflora to be systematically revealed, further establishing them
  as important candidate drugs in the treatment and management of RA.
