abstract: An important mechanism by which IFN-{$\gamma$} primes macrophages for enhanced
  innate immune responses is abrogation of feedback inhibitory pathways. Accordingly,
  IFN-{$\gamma$} abrogates endotoxin tolerance, a major negative feedback loop that
  silences expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in macrophages previously exposed
  to endotoxin/Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Mechanisms by which IFN-{$\gamma$}
  inhibits endotoxin tolerance have not been elucidated. Here, we show that pretreatment
  with IFN-{$\gamma$} prevented tolerization of primary human monocytes and restored
  TLR4-mediated induction of various proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and
  TNF{$\alpha$}. Surprisingly, IFN-{$\gamma$} did not alter proximal TLR4 signaling
  defects in tolerized monocytes. Instead, IFN-{$\gamma$} blocked tolerance-associated
  down-regulation of               IL6               and               TNF               transcription,
  RNA polymerase II recruitment, and NF-{$\kappa$}B and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein
  {$\beta$} transcription factor binding to the               IL6               and               TNF               promoters
  in tolerized monocytes. The mechanism by which IFN-{$\gamma$} restored               IL6               expression
  was by facilitating TLR4-induced recruitment of chromatin remodeling machinery to
  the               IL6               promoter and promoting               IL6               locus
  accessibility in tolerized monocytes. Our results suggest that IFN-{$\gamma$} overcomes
  endotoxin tolerance by facilitating TLR-induced chromatin remodeling to allow expression
  of proinflammatory genes. These results identify a mechanism by which IFN-{$\gamma$}
  promotes activation of macrophages and highlight the importance of chromatin remodeling
  and transcriptional control in the regulation of inflammatory cytokine production
  in tolerant and activated macrophages.
