abstract: '<jats:p>Results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be used
  to infer causal relationships between phenotypes, using a strategy known as 2-sample
  Mendelian randomization (2SMR) and bypassing the need for individual-level data.
  However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently
  curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed
  MR-Base (<jats:ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrbase.org">http://www.mrbase.org</jats:ext-link>):
  a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions
  according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface,
  web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity
  analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations
  of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait
  associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data
  with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and
  allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in
  phenome-wide association studies.</jats:p>'
