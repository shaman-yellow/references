  for Distinguished Young Scholars of China                                         Background               ~Acute
  heart failure (AHF) is a significant public health problem related to the high mortality
  and rehospitalization rate of patients. Although drug development is never interrupted,
  no single drug has been proven to play a decisive role in improving the survival
  of AHF patients. In China, multi-component traditional Chinese medicine~has been
  widely~used to treat AHF. As a Chinese herbal injection included in medical insurance,
  Yiqi Fumai Injection can reduce the level of NT-proBNP in AHF patients, improve
  heart function, and alleviate symptoms and signs related to heart failure. To further
  evaluate the therapeutic effect of Yiqi Fumai Injection on AHF, a multi-center,
  double-blind, randomized controlled trial that intends to recruit 1270 patients
  is being carried out in China. However, the mechanism of Yiqi Fumai Injection in
  the treatment of AHF has not been clarified. To further explore~the underlying mechanism,
  we used~systematic pharmacology methods to explore the potential molecular mechanisms
  of biologically active compounds.                                         Methods               ~We
  used the databases of HERB, the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM),
  the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
  (OMIM), and GeneCards to predict the active ingredients and potential targets of
  Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF. STRING was used for PPI network construction
  and analysis. Cytoscape was used to build a network between Chinese medicine, ingredients
  and targets. The DAVID, GO, and KEGG databases were used to predict the potential
  pathways of Yiqi Fumai Injection for the treatment of AHF.                                         Results               ~We
  obtained 31 active compounds of Yiqi Fumai Injection from HERB and ECTM databases.
  By overlapping targets between YQFMI and AHF, a total of 240 potential targets for
  Yiqi Fumai Injection to treat AHF were selected.~According to the H-C-T network
  topology analysis, the core compounds include beta-sitosterol, Uridine, Guanosine,
  and Stigmasterol. Sixteen protein targets had significantly higher node degrees
  than the average in the PPI network, including AKT1, JUN, TNF, EDN1, CASP3, ESR1,
  DLG4, PTGS2, NOS3, IL1B, C3, AR, LEP, CNR1, CHRM2, and DRD2. The PPI results showed
  that the potential therapeutic targets of YQFMI were densely enriched in pathways
  related to endothelial function, neuromodulation, and lipid metabolism.The same
  results were shown in GO and KEGG pathway enrichment.                                         Conclusion               ~Our
  results indicate that Yiqi Fumai Injection may achieve the goal of improving AHF-related
  symptoms by regulating the function of vascular endothelium and nerves and the biosynthetic
  pathway of lipid metabolism. These findings support previous studies and provide
  a reference for studying the mechanism of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment
  of AHF. Abstract Figure.'
