abstract: Sepsis is a common condition that is associated with unacceptably high mortality
  and, for many of those who survive, long-term morbidity. Increased awareness of
  the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research
  in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians
  and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and
  WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to
  improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition
  of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ
  dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ
  Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve definition of patient
  populations to allow for individualised management strategies matched to a patient's
  molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic
  techniques that can facilitate this aim, and for a pharmacological agent that can
  improve outcomes by modifying the disease process. While waiting for this goal to
  be achieved, improved basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programmes
  offers the best hope of increasing favourable outcomes.
