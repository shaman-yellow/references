abstract: Production of antigenic peptides that serve as MHC class I ligands is essential
  for initiation of cell-mediated immunity. Accumulating evidence indicates that the
  proteasome, a large multisubunit protein deg radative machine in eukaryotes, functions
  as a processing enzyme responsible for the generation of MHC class I ligands. This
  processing system is elaborately regulated by various immunomodulatory cytokines.
  In particular, interferon-gamma induces the formation of immunoproteasomes and a
  recently identified proteasomal regulatory factor. PA28, which in concert contribute
  to efficient production of MHC class I ligands. Many of the MHC-encoded genes including
  LMP appear to have emerged by an ancient chromosomal duplication, suggesting that
  modifications and renewal of pre-existing non-immune genes were instrumental in
  the emergence of adaptive immunity.
