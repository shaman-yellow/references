abstract: A key problem in computational proteomics is distinguishing between correct
  and false peptide identifications. We argue that evaluating the error rates of peptide
  identifications is not unlike computing generating functions in combinatorics. We
  show that the generating functions and their derivatives ( spectral energy and spectral
  probability) represent new features of tandem mass spectra that, similarly to Delta-scores,
  significantly improve peptide identifications. Furthermore, the spectral probability
  provides a rigorous solution to the problem of computing statistical significance
  of spectral identifications. The spectral energy/probability approach improves the
  sensitivity-specificity tradeoff of existing MS/MS search tools, addresses the notoriously
  difficult problem of "one-hit-wonders" in mass spectrometry, and often eliminates
  the need for decoy database searches. We therefore argue that the generating function
  approach has the potential to increase the number of peptide identifications in
  MS/MS searches.
