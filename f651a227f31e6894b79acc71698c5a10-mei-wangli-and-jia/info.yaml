abstract: Background. Despite the constant iteration of small-molecule inhibitors
  and immune checkpoint inhibitors, PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) patients with distant
  metastases and biochemical recurrence maintain a poor survival outcome along with
  an increasing morbidity in recent years. N7-Methylguanine, a new-found type of RNA
  modification, has demonstrated an essential role in tumor progression but has hardly
  been studied for its effect on prostate carcinoma. The current study aimed to seek
  m7G (N7-methylguanosine) related prognostic biomarkers and potential targets for
  PRAD treatment. Methods. 42 genes related to m7G were collected from former literatures
  and GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) website. Then, RNA-seq (RNA sequencing)
  and clinical data from TCGA-PRAD (The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate) cohort were
  retrieved to screen the differentially expressed m7G genes to further construct
  a multivariate Cox prognostic model for PRAD. Next, GSE116918, a prostate cancer
  cohort acquired from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database, was analyzed for the
  external validation group to assess the ability to predict BFFS (biochemical failure-free
  survival) of our m7G prognostic signature. Kaplan-Meier, ROC (receiver operator
  characteristic), AUC (areas under ROC curve), and calibration curves were adopted
  to display the performance of this prognostic signature. In addition, immune infiltration
  analysis was implemented to evaluate the effect of these m7G genes on immunoinfiltrating
  cells. Correlation with drug susceptibility of the m7G signature was also analyzed
  by matching drug information in CellMiner database. Results. The m7G-related prognostic
  signature, including three genes (EIF3D, EIF4A1, LARP1) illustrated superior prognostic
  ability for PRAD in both training and validation cohorts. The 5-year AUC were 0.768
  for TCGA-PRAD and 0.608 for GSE116918. It can well distinguish patients into different
  risk groups of biochemical recurrence (                                                   p                                               \,=1e-04
  for TCGA-PRAD and                                                   p                                               \,=0.0186
  for GSE116918). Immune infiltration analysis suggested potential regulation of m7G
  genes on neutrophils and dendritic cells in PRAD. Conclusions. A m7G-related prognostic
  signature was constructed and validated in the current study, giving new sights
  of m7G methylation in predicting the prognostic and improving the treatment of PRAD.
