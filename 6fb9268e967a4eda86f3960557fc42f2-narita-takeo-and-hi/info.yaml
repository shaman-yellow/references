abstract: 'Abstract                            Chromatin features are widely used
  for genome-scale mapping of enhancers. However, discriminating active enhancers
  from other               cis               -regulatory elements, predicting enhancer
  strength and identifying their target genes is challenging. Here we establish histone
  H2B N-terminus multisite lysine acetylation (H2BNTac) as a signature of active enhancers.
  H2BNTac prominently marks candidate active enhancers and a subset of promoters and
  discriminates them from ubiquitously active promoters. Two mechanisms underlie the
  distinct H2BNTac specificity: (1) unlike H3K27ac, H2BNTac is specifically catalyzed
  by CBP/p300; (2) H2A\textendash H2B, but not H3\textendash H4, are rapidly exchanged
  through transcription-induced nucleosome remodeling. H2BNTac-positive candidate
  enhancers show a high validation rate in orthogonal enhancer activity assays and
  a vast majority of endogenously active enhancers are marked by H2BNTac and H3K27ac.
  Notably, H2BNTac intensity predicts enhancer strength and outperforms current state-of-the-art
  models in predicting CBP/p300 target genes. These findings have broad implications
  for generating fine-grained enhancer maps and modeling CBP/p300-dependent gene regulation.'
