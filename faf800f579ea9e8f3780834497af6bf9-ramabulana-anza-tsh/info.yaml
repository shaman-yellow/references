abstract: Momordica plant species (Cucurbitaceae), have been used for centuries in
  traditional medicine and for nutritional purposes. Plants from this family are  thus
  claimed to be phytochemically rich, representing an inexhaustible source of  natural
  products. However, the chemical space of these Momordica species has not  yet been
  fully decoded, and due to the inherent complexity of plant metabolomes,  the characterization
  of the Momordica phytochemistry remains challenging. Thus,  in this study we propose
  the use of molecular networking to unravel the molecular  families within the metabolomes
  of four Momordica species (M. cardiospermoides,  M. balsamina, M. charantia and
  M. foetida) and highlight the relevance of  molecular networking in exploring the
  chemotaxonomy of these plants. In silico  annotation tools (Network Annotation Propagation
  and DEREPLICATOR) and an  unsupervised substructure identification tool (MS2LDA)
  were also explored to  complement the classical molecular networking output and
  integration using  MolNetEnhancer within GNPS. This allowed for the visualisation
  of chemical  classes and the variety of substructures within the molecular families.
  The use  of computational tools in this study highlighted various classes of metabolites,  such
  as a wide range of flavonoids, terpenoids and lipids. Herein, these species  are
  revealed to be phytochemically rich plants consisting of many biologically  active
  metabolites differentially distributed within the different species, with  the metabolome
  of M. cardiospermoides dereplicated in this paper for the first  time.
