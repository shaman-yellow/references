abstract: In mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics, rarely more than 30\%
  of the compounds are identified. Without the true identity of these molecules it
  is impossible to draw conclusions about the biological mechanisms, pathway relationships
  and provenance of compounds. The only way at present to address this discrepancy
  is to use in silico fragmentation software to identify unknown compounds by comparing
  and ranking theoretical MS/MS fragmentations from target structures to experimental
  tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). We compared the performance of four publicly available
  in silico fragmentation algorithms (MetFragCL, CFM-ID, MAGMa+ and MS-FINDER) that
  participated in the 2016 CASMI challenge. We found that optimizing the use of metadata,
  weighting factors and the manner of combining different tools eventually defined
  the ultimate outcomes of each method. We comprehensively analysed how outcomes of
  different tools could be combined and reached a final success rate of 93\% for the
  training data, and 87\% for the challenge data, using a combination of MAGMa+, CFM-ID
  and compound importance information along with MS/MS matching. Matching MS/MS spectra
  against the MS/MS libraries without using any in silico tool yielded 60\% correct
  hits, showing that the use of in silico methods is still important.
