abstract: Bipolaris sorokiniana is an important biotic constraint for global wheat
  production, causing spot blotch disease. In this work, we present a comprehensive  characterization
  of the cell-free culture filtrate (CF) and precipitated fraction  (PF) of Bacillus
  cabrialesii TE3(T) showing an effective inhibition of spot  blotch. Our results
  indicated that CF produced by B. cabrialesii TE3(T) inhibits  the growth of B. sorokiniana
  through stable metabolites (after autoclaving and  proteinase K treatment). Antifungal
  metabolites in CF and PF were explored by an  integrated genomic-metabolomic approach.
  Genome-mining revealed that strain  TE3(T) contains the biosynthetic potential to
  produce wide spectrum antifungal  (surfactin, fengycin, and rhizocticin A) and antibacterial
  metabolites  (bacillaene, bacilysin, bacillibactin, and subtilosin A), and through  bioactivity-guided
  LC-ESI-MS/MS approach we determined that a lipopeptide complex  of surfactin and
  fengycin homologs was responsible for antifungal activity  exhibited by B. cabrialesii
  TE3(T) against the studied phytopathogen. In  addition, our results demonstrate
  that i) a lipopeptide complex inhibits B.  sorokiniana by disrupting its cytoplasmatic
  membrane and ii) reduced spot blotch  disease by 93 \%. These findings show the
  potential application of metabolites  produced by strain TE3(T) against B. sorokiniana
  and provide the first insight  into antifungal metabolites produced by the novel
  Bacillus species, Bacillus  cabrialesii.
