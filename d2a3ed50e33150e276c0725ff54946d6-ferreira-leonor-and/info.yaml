abstract: The Blue Biotechnology and Ecotoxicology Culture Collection (LEGE-CC) holds
  a vast number of cyanobacteria whose chemical richness is still largely unknown.
  To  expedite its bioactivity screening we developed a natural products library.
  Sixty  strains and four environmental samples were chromatographed, using a  semiautomatic
  HPLC system, yielding 512 fractions that were tested for their  cytotoxic activity
  against 2D and 3D models of human colon carcinoma (HCT 116),  and non-cancerous
  cell line hCMEC/D3. Six fractions showed high cytotoxicity  against 2D and 3D cell
  models (group A), and six other fractions were selected by  their effects on 3D
  cells (group B). The metabolome of each group was organized  and characterized using
  the MolNetEnhancer workflow, and its processing with  MetaboAnalyst allowed discrimination
  of the mass features with the highest fold  change, and thus the ones that might
  be bioactive. Of those, mass features  without precedented identification were mostly
  found in group A, indicating seven  possible novel bioactive molecules, alongside
  in silico putative annotation of  five cytotoxic compounds. Manual dereplication
  of group B tentatively identified  nine pheophytin and pheophorbide derivatives.
  Our approach enabled the selection  of 7 out of 60 cyanobacterial strains for anticancer
  drug discovery, providing  new data concerning the chemical composition of these
  cyanobacteria.
