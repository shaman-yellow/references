abstract: Abstract                            Untargeted metabolomics experiments
  rely on spectral libraries for structure annotation, but, typically, only a small
  fraction of spectra can be matched. Previous in silico methods search in structure
  databases but cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect annotations. Here
  we introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines in silico structure database generation
  and annotation with a confidence score consisting of kernel density               P               value
  estimation and a support vector machine with enforced directionality of features.
  On diverse datasets, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at low false
  discovery rates and outperforms spectral library search. To demonstrate that COSMIC
  can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated 12 natural bile acids.
  The annotation of nine structures was confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures
  using synthetic standards. In human samples, we annotated and manually validated
  315 molecular structures currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Application
  of COSMIC to data from 17,400 metabolomics experiments led to 1,715 high-confidence
  structural annotations that were absent from spectral libraries.
