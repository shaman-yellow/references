abstract: The traditional use of plants and their preparations in the treatment of
  diseases as a first medication in the past centuries indicates the presence of active
  components for specific targets in the natural material. Many of the tested plants
  in this study have been traditionally used in the treatment of Diabetes mellitus
  type 2 and associated symptoms in different cultural areas. Additionally, hypoglycemic
  effects, such as a decrease in blood glucose concentration, have been demonstrated               in
  vivo               for these plants. In order to determine the mode of action, the
  plants were prepared as methanolic and aqueous extracts and tested for their effects
  on intestinal glucose and fructose absorption in Caco2 cells. The results of this
  screening showed significant and reproducible inhibition of glucose uptake between
  40 and 80\% by methanolic extracts made from the fruits of               Aronia
  melanocarpa               ,               Cornus officinalis               ,               Crataegus
  pinnatifida               ,               Lycium chinense               , and               Vaccinium
  myrtillus               ; the leaves of               Brassica oleracea               ,               Juglans
  regia               , and               Peumus boldus               ; and the roots
  of               Adenophora triphylla               . Furthermore, glucose uptake
  was inhibited between 50 and 70\% by aqueous extracts made from the bark of               Eucommia
  ulmoides               and the fruit skin of               Malus domestica               .
  The methanolic extracts of               Juglans regia               and               Peumus
  boldus               inhibited the fructose transport between 30 and 40\% in Caco2
  cells as well. These findings can be considered as fundamental work for further
  research regarding the treatment of obesity-correlated diseases, such as Diabetes
  mellitus type 2.
