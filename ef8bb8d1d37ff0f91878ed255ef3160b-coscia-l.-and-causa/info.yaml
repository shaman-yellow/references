abstract: RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are newly synthetized N-[8-R-dibenzo(b,f)oxepin-10-yl]-N'-methyl-piperazine-maleates
  which show interesting psychopharmacologic effects. This work contains the results
  of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic
  activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The
  inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal
  spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity
  is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis
  can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just
  as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction
  of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity.
  They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance
  behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as
  catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us.
  As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action
  ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic
  activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects,
  as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140,
  RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and
  more potent than those of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines
  show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level.
