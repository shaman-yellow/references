abstract: Abstract             MaxDIA is a software platform for analyzing data-independent
  acquisition (DIA) proteomics data within the MaxQuant software environment. Using
  spectral libraries, MaxDIA achieves deep proteome coverage with substantially better
  coefficients of variation in protein quantification than other software. MaxDIA
  is equipped with accurate false discovery rate (FDR) estimates on both library-to-DIA
  match and protein levels, including when using whole-proteome predicted spectral
  libraries. This is the foundation of discovery DIA\textemdash hypothesis-free analysis
  of DIA samples without library and with reliable FDR control. MaxDIA performs three-
  or four-dimensional feature detection of fragment data, and scoring of matches is
  augmented by machine learning on the features of an identification. MaxDIA's bootstrap
  DIA workflow performs multiple rounds of matching with increasing quality of recalibration
  and stringency of matching to the library. Combining MaxDIA with two new technologies\textemdash
  BoxCar acquisition and trapped ion mobility spectrometry\textemdash both lead to
  deep and accurate proteome quantification.
