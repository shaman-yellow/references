abstract: ChEBI (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi) is a database and ontology of chemical
  entities of biological interest. Over the past few years, ChEBI has continued to
  grow steadily in content, and has added several new features. In addition to incorporating
  all user-requested compounds, our annotation efforts have emphasized immunology,
  natural products and metabolites in many species. All database entries are now 'is\_a'
  classified within the ontology, meaning that all of the chemicals are available
  to semantic reasoning tools that harness the classification hierarchy. We have completely
  aligned the ontology with the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry-recommended
  upper level Basic Formal Ontology. Furthermore, we have aligned our chemical classification
  with the classification of chemical-involving processes in the Gene Ontology (GO),
  and as a result of this effort, the majority of chemical-involving processes in
  GO are now defined in terms of the ChEBI entities that participate in them. This
  effort necessitated incorporating many additional biologically relevant compounds.
  We have incorporated additional data types including reference citations, and the
  species and component for metabolites. Finally, our website and web services have
  had several enhancements, most notably the provision of a dynamic new interactive
  graph-based ontology visualization.
