abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The in silico fragmenter MetFrag, launched in 2010, was one
  of the first approaches combining compound database searching and fragmentation
  prediction for small molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry data.
  Since then many new approaches have evolved, as has MetFrag itself. This article
  details the latest developments to MetFrag and its use in small molecule identification
  since the original publication. RESULTS: MetFrag has gone through algorithmic and
  scoring refinements. New features include the retrieval of reference, data source
  and patent information via ChemSpider and PubChem web services, as well as InChIKey
  filtering to reduce candidate redundancy due to stereoisomerism. Candidates can
  be filtered or scored differently based on criteria like occurence of certain elements
  and/or substructures prior to fragmentation, or presence in so-called "suspect lists".
  Retention time information can now be calculated either within MetFrag with a sufficient
  amount of user-provided retention times, or incorporated separately as "user-defined
  scores" to be included in candidate ranking. The changes to MetFrag were evaluated
  on the original dataset as well as a dataset of 473 merged high resolution tandem
  mass spectra (HR-MS/MS) and compared with another open source in silico fragmenter,
  CFM-ID. Using HR-MS/MS information only, MetFrag2.2 and CFM-ID had 30~and 43~Top
  1 ranks, respectively, using PubChem as a database. Including reference and retention
  information in MetFrag2.2 improved this to 420 and 336 Top~1 ranks with ChemSpider
  and PubChem (89 and 71~\%), respectively, and even up to 343~Top 1 ranks (PubChem)
  when combining with CFM-ID. The optimal parameters and weights were verified using
  three additional datasets of 824 merged HR-MS/MS spectra in total. Further examples
  are given to demonstrate flexibility of the enhanced features. CONCLUSIONS: In many
  cases additional information is available from the experimental context to add to
  small molecule identification, which is especially useful where the mass spectrum
  alone is not sufficient for candidate selection from a large number of candidates.
  The results achieved with MetFrag2.2 clearly show the benefit of considering this
  additional information. The new functions greatly enhance the chance of identification
  success and have been incorporated into a command line interface in a flexible way
  designed to be integrated into high throughput workflows. Feedback on the command
  line version of MetFrag2.2 available at http://c-ruttkies.github.io/MetFrag/ is
  welcome.'
