abstract: Abstract                            Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are classified
  according to their histological features. Accurate classification of RCC and comprehensive
  understanding of their metabolic dysregulation are of critical importance. Here
  we investigate the use of metabolomic analyses to classify the main RCC subtypes
  and to describe the metabolic variation for each subtype. To this end, we performed
  metabolomic profiling of 65 RCC frozen samples (40 clear cell, 14 papillary and
  11 chromophobe) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. OPLS-DA multivariate
  analysis based on metabolomic data showed clear discrimination of all three main
  subtypes of RCC (R               2               \,=\,75.0\%, Q               2               \,=\,59.7\%).
  The prognostic performance was evaluated using an independent cohort and showed
  an AUROC of 0.924, 0.991 and 1 for clear cell, papillary and chromophobe RCC, respectively.
  Further pathway analysis using the 21 top metabolites showed significant differences
  in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism between three RCC subtypes. In conclusion,
  this study shows that metabolomic profiling could serve as a tool that is complementary
  to histology for RCC subtype classification. An overview of metabolic dysregulation
  in RCC subtypes was established giving new insights into the understanding of their
  clinical behaviour and for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.
