abstract: Metabolomics, which is the profiling of metabolites in biofluids, cells
  and tissues, is routinely applied as a tool for biomarker discovery. Owing to innovative
  developments in informatics and analytical technologies, and the integration of
  orthogonal biological approaches, it is now possible to expand metabolomic analyses
  to understand the systems-level effects of metabolites. Moreover, because of the
  inherent sensitivity of metabolomics, subtle alterations in biological pathways
  can be detected to provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie various physiological
  conditions and aberrant processes, including diseases.
