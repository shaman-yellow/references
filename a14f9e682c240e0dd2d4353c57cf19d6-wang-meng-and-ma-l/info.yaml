abstract: Excess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a predominant
  cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, increasing
  attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of
  n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining
  the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute
  ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol
  feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results
  of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial,
  increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating
  alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms,
  including decreased de novo lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue,
  enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid {$\beta$}-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation
  and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting
  that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3
  PUFAs ex vivo in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related
  studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3
  PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized,
  placebo-controlled clinic trial. ABBREVIATION AA arachidonic acid ACC acetyl-CoA
